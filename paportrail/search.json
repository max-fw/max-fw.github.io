Open data is research data that anyone can use, access, and share.\nResearch data is information collected, generated, recorded, or used to validate or underpin the primary findings of a research project or study.\nData can exist in many formats like images, data sets, musical compositions, guidelines, multimedia, code, software, and more. Making data open and available is an important part of open research.\nWhat is open data? In the past, open data has not been the norm. Technological developments have removed many of the barriers to sharing data.\nOpen data is not yet universal, but is increasingly standard practice. Open data requires a minimum standard of data quality to ensure its reusability. Adoption of minimum standards for open data is still in its infancy. But as the culture of open research grows, so too does the development of open data standards.\nHow does open data facilitate data accessibility and reusability?\n\nBy making data open, researchers are enhancing the reproducibility and transparency of their research outputs.\nMaking data open means data can be accessed by and presented to a larger audience.\nThe data can be reused by different researchers over time to answer new research questions.\nMaking data open can save time in data collection and maximizes research resources.",

The Covid 19 pandemic provides a stark example of the ways poor research design can lead to poor outcomes. It also shows how open research can help us identify invalid results before they become the basis for bad clinical practice.\nFor example, during the pandemic, a trial was conducted to assess the use of hydroxychloricquin, an antimmalarial drug to treat severe CO 19. The study reported reduced mortality in patients who received the drug. As a result, hydroxychloricquin began to be touted as a cure.\nBut when a preprint of the study was published and other researchers began to review it, they identified a major flaw in the study design. This flaw likely affected the results. So the paper was withdrawn and hydroxychloricquin is not an approved treatment for Covid 19.",

If you agree, I plan to combine the videos into one, and slides into one.\nBelow video is the first of 8 videos - put here as a placeholder. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo transcript: Why is Open Research Important?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is open research important?\n\nThe open research movement is rapidly growing worldwide with more researchers, funders, and publishers embracing it.\nThere are benefits of open research for research, researchers and students and society.\n\nBenefits of open research for research include: - Increased research transparency and reproducibility - Enhanced accessibility and reusability of data - Less poor research practices and greater research accountability - Increased opportunities for research collaboration - Improved visibility of research findings - Encouragement of broader society participation in research\nIncreased Transparency and Reproducibility\nHow does open research increase transparency and reproducibility of research outputs? In what ways does open research increase transparency and reproducibility of research outputs? By being very clear and outlining exactly what was done and how it was done. This can include clearly stating what, when, and or how archives or repositories were searched to identify research documents.\nIt could also include clearly outlining all steps in an experimental study and/or all the steps and statistical code used to analyze data.\nHow does open research increase transparency and reproducibility of research outputs? Open research also encourages researchers to share their data with other researchers.\nData is information collected, recorded, or created during the research process to validate research findings.\nData can be made available on online repositories. Open data helps other researchers to independently validate or attempt to reproduce the research.\nEnhanced accessibility and reusability of data\nWhat is open data? Open data is research data that anyone can use, access, and share.\nResearch data is information collected, generated, recorded, or used to validate or underpin the primary findings of a research project or study.\nData can exist in many formats like images, data sets, musical compositions, guidelines, multimedia, code, software, and more. Making data open and available is an important part of open research.\nWhat is open data?\nIn the past, open data has not been the norm. Technological developments have removed many of the barriers to sharing data.\nOpen data is not yet universal, but is increasingly standard practice. Open data requires a minimum standard of data quality to ensure its reusability. Adoption of minimum standards for open data is still in its infancy. But as the culture of open research grows, so too does the development of open data standards.\nHow does open data facilitate data accessibility and reusability?\n\nBy making data open, researchers are enhancing the reproducibility and transparency of their research outputs.\nMaking data open means data can be accessed by and presented to a larger audience.\nThe data can be reused by different researchers over time to answer new research questions.\nMaking data open can save time in data collection and maximizes research resources.\n\nLess poor research practices and greater research accountability\nHow does open research discourage poor research practices? Open research encourages researchers to publicly disclose the details of their methods. These can then be reviewed, assessed, and validated by other researchers. This may discourage use of questionable research practices.\nHow does open research help us identify methodological issues in research? The case of Covid 19. The Covid 19 pandemic provides a stark example of the ways poor research design can lead to poor outcomes. It also shows how open research can help us identify invalid results before they become the basis for bad clinical practice.\nFor example, during the pandemic, a trial was conducted to assess the use of hydroxychloricquin, an antimmalarial drug to treat severe CO 19. The study reported reduced mortality in patients who received the drug. As a result, hydroxychloricquin began to be touted as a cure.\nBut when a preprint of the study was published and other researchers began to review it, they identified a major flaw in the study design. This flaw likely affected the results. So the paper was withdrawn and hydroxychloricquin is not an approved treatment for Covid 19.\nIncreased opportunities for research collaboration\nHow does open research encourage collaboration? Open research enhances worldwide and interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers. This is facilitated by: 1. Open data whereby data of any kind is openly accessible. 2. Collaborative platforms for sharing information, tools, and resources.\nOpen research collaboration accelerates discovery and design by bringing together knowledge, tools, and expertise.\nHow does open research encourage collaboration, the case of Covid 19? During the pandemic, researchers from across the globe collaborated and shared data to better understand the disease and work towards preventive and treatment approaches.\nThere are also open research repositories dedicated specifically to Covid 19 research. For example, the World Economic Forum Global Science Collaboration Covid 19.\nImproved visibility of research findings\nHow does open research improve visibility and engagement with research?\nOpen research includes making final research products openly accessible. It can also include engaging in alternative ways of sharing research. This can increase the likelihood that research will be read and engaged with. Open research also tends to get more media attention, increasing visibility.\nHow does open research improve visibility and engagement with research?\nTake a look at this TEDex talk about memory to see how the speaker makes the research topic engaging and interesting.\nEncouragement of broader society participation in research\nHow does open research encourage societal participation in research?\nIncluding members of the public when conducting research is important for a number of reasons.\n\nIt enhances the relevance and impact of your research.\nIt helps to ensure fair access to knowledge and reduce inequalities.\nInclusion of the public in conducting research is called citizen research.\n\nHow does open research encourage societal participation in research?\n\nOpen research findings and outputs can be freely accessed by the public. This means there are no fees or need to use an institutional login.\nOpen research makes it easier for research to reach the public. This means people outside academia can engage with research outputs.\nIt is not just research papers that can be made freely available. Textbooks can be made openly available too. For example, via open textbook library.\n\nSharing of knowledge in open research also involves non-traditional roots including social media, public talks, blogs, visuals, and infographics. Using diverse approaches to share knowledge and research increases the likelihood that people can and will engage with it.\nTake a look at the next set of slides and/or recording to see why open research is important for you.\nWhy is open research important for me?\nWe come across research findings every day in the news, on television, and online. Having a better understanding of open research allows you to better engage with the research you read and hear about.\nUnderstanding good practices and spotting bad practices means you can judge how reliable and trustworthy a piece of research is.\nIf you go on to apply for a master’s or PhD funding, research funders increasingly require open research practices for grant applications.\nIf you decide to publish your project, many journals now encourage open practices, including registering studies in advance and sharing data.\nSome journals also award badges for open research practices.\nSharing your research also means it’s more likely to be read and or engaged with, meaning you have a greater chance of making an impact with your research.\nBy sharing drafts of research early, you can get feedback from researchers all over the world to help improve your research. This can be scary, but it can also be worth it.\nSharing data and research materials online also means they can be cited by other researchers because they are assigned digital object identifiers, DOIs.\nHow often your work is cited is an academic metric that is often used to decide on job opportunities and promotions.\nIf you use open research approaches, future prospective employers will be able to see your research outputs and processes. This can enhance your job applications, including outside research in academia.\nComplete the activity on Canvas to reflect on how your research goals and priorities align with the benefits of open research.",

Open research practices or methods are relevant at all stages of the research process, including research planning, data collection, data analysis, writing up and publishing findings, and disseminating and sharing your research.\nEach of the open research practices introduced here are discussed in the next sections.\nResearch integrity\nGuiding principles of research integrity.\nResearch integrity involves making honest and responsible decisions at all stages of the research cycle. It prioritizes reliability, ensuring quality of research at all stages of the research process, honesty, developing, conducting, sharing, and engaging with research in fair, transparent ways.\nRespect for research participants, colleagues, society, culture, and the environment. And accountability for the research, its management, and for wider impacts.\nWhy is research integrity important? 1. It reduces the likelihood of research misconduct. 2. It ensures the validity of research results. 3. It facilitates trust between researchers. 4. It promotes trust in data and research expertise.\nPre-registration\nA pre-registration is a record of research processes. It is created and shared before data are collected or become accessible. It is a timestamped record of decisions about study design, methods, and analysis. Pre-registration documents should be publicly available. There are dedicated repositories to make pre-registrations available.\nWhy is pre-registration important? 1. It encourages researchers to identify the goals of their project before collecting any data. 2. It creates accountability in research. 3. It discourages researchers from conducting after the-actalyses to find significant, novel, and or exciting results. 4. It makes research findings easier to find.\nOpen reporting\nResearch involves choices and revisions at each stage. Open reporting allows us to make our processes and our outputs transparent.\nOpen reporting involves providing a full, clear, and specific account of how research was conducted. It is supported by use of open reporting checklists.\nWhy is open reporting important?\n\nIt allows researchers to detail their processes and decisions at all stages of the research cycle.\nIt enhances other researchers ability to evaluate a study’s results.\nIt enhances other researchers abilities to reproduce a study’s results.\nIt benefits decision making at individual and societal levels because decisions can be made on transparent processes and findings.\n\nData management\nData is all information collected, observed, recorded or created throughout the research process. It can include spreadsheets, videos, audios, notes, diaries, images.\nData management. Research data management is the organization, storage and preservation of research data during active research and post project.\nA data management plan or DMP is a living document which describes the organization, storage, preservation and potential sharing of research data and is an integral part of open research practice.\nWhy is data management important?\n\nIt helps you keep track of your own work.\nIt protects against data loss.\nIt increases research efficiency.\nIt minimizes errors in data mission.\nThere are funding and publishing incentives related to data management.\nThere are institutional and/or legal data management requirements.\n\nWhy is open data important?\nRemember that open data is data made publicly available. 1. It enhances accountability. 2. It enhances transparency. 3. It enhances reproducibility. 4. It facilitates revisiting and building on existing data. 5. It facilitates better and stronger collaborations. 6. It is better value for the public money that funds much research.\nOpen knowledge dissemination\nOpen knowledge dissemination means communicating knowledge gained from research in open and accessible ways. This expands on the traditional approach to sharing research knowledge, which involves publishing it in an academic journal that can often only be accessed by paying a fee.\nApproaches to open knowledge dissemination include open access publishing. Anyone can access the published research without paying a fee. Preprints, versions of research papers made available online before being peer-reviewed and published. Repositories, databases people can use to store and access research papers and/or data sets.\nScience communication. sharing research in a way that increases appreciation, excitement, understanding and impact of research and data visualization representing data graphically or visually to increase its accessibility.\nWhy is open knowledge dissemination important?\n\nIt increases public access to and interest in research.\nIt increases the transparency and openness of research.\nIt helps reshape what is considered important in research and academia.\n\nFor the activity for this section, complete the activity on Canvas to reflect on where in the research cycle different open research practices are relevant.",

Speak with your supervisor about using open research approaches in your current work. We know it may not be possible to do all of the open research practices, but using any of the practices is a great start.\nGetting started with open research\nOpen science networks. You can set up your own network with fellow students. This doesn’t need to be a formal network. It can just be a place to come together and talk about open research. Getting started with open research Twitter accounts to follow.\nAdditional modules. Don’t forget that you can take any all of our follow-on modules to learn more about how to do open research.\nAnd for the final activity, read the open research article on Canvas and reflect on the open research practices used and how you could include these in a research project.",

    "text": "What practices can compromise research integrity?\nPlagiarism, including self-plagiarism, giving or taking credit for work inappropriately.\nFabricating data, misrepresenting data, manipulation of images or other materials, undeclared conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat is plagiarism?\nPlagiarism is a practice of misrepresenting someone else’s words or ideas as your own. It is also possible to self-plagiarize.\nThis happens when an author passes off old work as new. For example, by submitting one paper for credit in two separate modules.\nHow do you avoid plagiarism?\n\nAlways acknowledge the work and contributions of other people.\nWhen paraphrasing or summarizing someone else’s work, include a citation.\nIf including text from someone else’s work verbatim, use quotation marks and include a citation.\nCite primary sources of information rather than secondary or tertiary sources.\n\nYour university will have resources to help you avoid plagiarism, too. In UCC, for example, a citing, referencing, and plagiarism course is available here.\nAnd check out this video on how to cite sources. And this one on examples of plagiarism. They are short but very useful. Giving or taking credit for work inappropriately.\nIf someone makes a meaningful contribution to a research project, they should receive credit for their contribution. This might mean they are an author on a final paper or receive an acknowledgement on that paper.\nThere is guidance to determine if someone makes a meaningful contribution like the IC JME criteria.\nYou might also ask yourself, did they contribute to the study idea design? Did they conduct analyses or contribute to interpreting findings? Did they assist with writing up the final report paper?\nIf someone doesn’t make a meaningful contribution, they shouldn’t be given credit. For instance, listing uninvolved members of a research group or more senior academics who only looked at the final paper. These kind of authors are sometimes called ghost authors.\n\n\nData fabrication\nData fabrication is a process of manufacturing or making up data. For example, an anthropologist might write transcripts of interviews they never conducted. These transcripts, false data, might become part of the research record.\nThis can result in unreliable data and waste research resources through attempted replications.\nCovid 19 example. A paper published in 2020 reported increased risk of debt for people hospitalized with Covid 19 if they had underlying cardiovascular disease. Findings were based on data supposedly collected by the company of one of the study authors. It quickly became apparent that the data was fraudulent. The paper was retracted, but such questionable practices can undermine trust in research.\n\n\nData misrepresentation\nData misrepresentation is a practice of presenting real data in a misleading way. Researchers might emphasize exciting or novel findings only. Researchers might also distort or duplicate images of their findings.\nSome researchers even magnified or reverse their images to try and avoid detection. Data misrepresentation gives an incomplete picture of the research findings. Like other questionable research practices, it can result in unreliable data. It can also waste research resources through attempted replications.\nPiracy and manipulation of images, other materials\nSometimes researchers manipulate figures, images, or other resources to include them in multiple research papers. Often these manipulated materials come from organizations known as paper mills.\nPaper mills turn out fake data, images, and whole papers to meet demand from researchers. But there are also researchers working to identify this manipulated content so it can be retracted.\n\n\nUndeclared conflicts of interest\nA conflict of interest is when a researcher’s other interests lead to intentional or unintentional biases in research.\nConflicts of interest may in turn compromise the validity of the results. For example, a researcher receiving funding for pharmaceutical development may be incentivized to demonstrate that competitors drugs are unsafe or inferior. This may shape how they conduct their research and impact the findings which will influence people’s health and care in the future.\nWhy do people engage in research misconduct?\nThere are several factors that can motivate research misconduct. Some are emotional like fear of failure. Misconduct may also be motivated by external pressures like pressure from supervisors to achieve a certain result.\nResearchers may also feel pressure to perform due to the competitiveness of academic culture. Worries about personal circumstances like employment status might also motivate misconduct.",

It builds your reputation as a researcher and allows you to take credit for your ideas and plans. You may also be able to earn a digital badge for pre-registering your study. These are offered by over 60 research journals in multiple disciplines.\nWhy aren’t all studies pre-registered?\nPre-registration might present challenges for some types of research like exploratory research or secondary analysis. But challenges do not mean it can’t be done.\nWhy aren’t all studies pre-registered? Pre-registration takes time, planning, and figuring out requirements for pre-registration for the target repository.\nSome researchers think pre-registration is not applicable or appropriate for more constructivist research. But being transparent about what we plan to do before we begin our research projects is important for any type of research.",

And what if I want to change my research plan?\nYour pre-registration is the research plan you will put together with your supervisor and or for ethics approval. So you will be doing much of the work anyway. There are lots of resources and templates you can use to pre-register. This makes it much easier.\nYou can also update your pre-registration up until you begin data analysis. Your pre-registration will outline how you plan to conduct your study and can be amended up to a point.\nOkay, sounds good. So, how do I actually do it?\nTo pre-register your study, you need to decide the following in advance: your study design and methods, how you will collect your data, and how you will analyze your data.\n\nYou should have a clear plan including all the relevant information and details.\nYou then need to decide where you are going to pre-register your study.\nDifferent pre-registration platforms will provide templates for pre-registering your study.\nTemplates are meant to serve as a guide because pre-registration may require some flexibility.\n\nDifferent disciplines may require different methods for pre-registration. A list of discipline specific templates is included in the additional resources section. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other applicable templates.\n\nPre-registering on OSF\nOSF Open Science Framework is a popular repository or platform for pre-registering projects. For this reason, paper trail focuses on OSF for pre-registration.\nPre-registering on OSF. A complete guide to pre-registering projects on OSF is available on their website here. A brief overview is presented on the next slide.\nRemember, another platform may be more suitable for you, but for this course, we are just focusing on OSF.\nHere are the steps to pre-register on OSF:\n\nSet up an account on the Open Science Framework.\nSelect to start a new pre-registration.\nInclude your project title and a description. This is called your metadata.\nInclude your research plan. This is your research design or approach and how you will collect and analyze data.\nRegister it and make it public. You can make it immediately public or public at a later date.\nPreview and review your pre-registration.\nYou can add attachments if you need more space or have additional components to share.\n\nPre-registering on OSF, the finished project\nOn screen is an OSF pre-registration study protocol of the study factors that impact on the practice of open science by early career health researchers, a mixed method study.

Studies are then reviewed. If the review is favorable, the study receives an inprincipal acceptance and is registered in a repository. The research is then conducted.\nStage II Researchers then submit completed manuscripts including:\n\nA justification for the work, and\nThe approved protocol from stage one and\nResults, discussion and any exploratory analysis.\n\nHow do you publish a registered report?\nPlan your study. Submit study proposal to a journal. The proposal will be reviewed. Receive and respond to any feedbackand then if accepted do the study and publish the final paper in the journal.\nWhy are registered reports important?\n\nThey put the focus on the research question and the methodological quality of the study.\nThey alleviate perceived pressures to obtain significant or exciting results and to publish.\nMany journals are starting to adopt registered reports as standard practice.",

Below is the first of 4 videos, shown here as a placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo transcript - Pre-registration\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is pre-registration?\nPre-registration is timestamped. A timestamped record of research processes and decisions. It’s created in advance, created and shared before data are collected or become accessible and made publicly available. The pre-registration document should be publicly available on a registry or repository.\nHow is this different to an ethics application? For many research projects, you will need to submit an ethics application. This is typical for studies involving people, existing data, and in the sciences.\nHow is a pre-registration different to an ethics application? Pre-registrations and ethics applications contain much of the same information, but they serve different aims.\nWhy is pre-registration important?\n\nIt encourages researchers to identify the goals of their project before collecting data or starting analysis.\nIt creates accountability in research.\nIt discourages researchers from conducting after the fact analyses to find significant, novel, or exciting results.\nIt helps researchers manage the personal biases that might influence their research.\nIt makes research findings easier to locate.\n\nWhy should you pre-register your study?\nPre-registration is easy once you’ve learned how to do it. It builds your reputation as a researcher and allows you to take credit for your ideas and plans. You may also be able to earn a digital badge for pre-registering your study. These are offered by over 60 research journals in multiple disciplines.\nWhy aren’t all studies pre-registered?\nPre-registration might present challenges for some types of research like exploratory research or secondary analysis. But challenges do not mean it can’t be done.\nWhy aren’t all studies pre-registered? Pre-registration takes time, planning, and figuring out requirements for pre-registration for the target repository.\nSome researchers think pre-registration is not applicable or appropriate for more constructivist research. But being transparent about what we plan to do before we begin our research projects is important for any type of research.\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nPre-registering your study. It sounds like a lot of work. And what if I want to change my research plan?\nPre-registering your study. Your pre-registration is the research plan you will put together with your supervisor and or for ethics approval. So you will be doing much of the work anyway. There are lots of resources and templates you can use to pre-register. This makes it much easier.\nPre-registering your study. You can also update your pre-registration up until you begin data analysis. Your pre-registration will outline how you plan to conduct your study and can be amended up to a point.\nOkay, sounds good. So, how do I actually do it?\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nTo pre-register your study, you need to decide the following in advance. Your study design and methods, how you will collect your data, and how you will analyze your data.\nHow do you pre-register a study?\n\nYou should have a clear plan including all the relevant information and details.\nYou then need to decide where you are going to pre-register your study.\nDifferent pre-registration platforms will provide templates for pre-registering your study.\nTemplates are meant to serve as a guide because pre-registration may require some flexibility.\n\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nDifferent disciplines may require different methods for pre-registration. A list of discipline specific templates is included in the additional resources section. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other applicable templates.\nPre-registering on OSF.\nOSF Open Science Framework is a popular repository or platform for pre-registering projects. For this reason, paper trail focuses on OSF for pre-registration.\nPre-registering on OSF. A complete guide to pre-registering projects on OSF is available on their website here. A brief overview is presented on the next slide.\nRemember, another platform may be more suitable for you, but for this course, we are just focusing on OSF.\nPre-registering on OSF.\n\nSet up an account on the Open Science Framework.\nSelect to start a new pre-registration.\nInclude your project title and a description. This is called your metadata.\nInclude your research plan. This is your research design or approach and how you will collect and analyze data.\nRegister it and make it public. You can make it immediately public or public at a later date.\nPreview and review your pre-registration.\nYou can add attachments if you need more space or have additional components to share.\n\nPre-registering on OSF, the finished project.\nOn screen is an OSF pre-registration study protocol of the study factors that impact on the practice of open science by early career health researchers, a mixed method study. The full pre-registration of this study is included in the resources for your reference.\nWhat is a registered report?\nTypically, when we want to publish a paper, we submit it to a journal after the study is finished. The journal and its peer reviewers then decide if the study can be published in that journal.\nThere is evidence that studies with significant novel or exciting findings are more likely to get published.\nWhat are registered reports?\n\nRegistered reports are research papers outlining the proposed study methods and approach.\nThe potential for publication of these papers is evaluated by the journal before any data collection.\nThis means they are evaluating the proposed study methods rather than the findings.\n\nWhat is a Registered Report?\nStage I\nResearchers submit their research question, questions, theory, hypothesis, detailed methods, analysis plans, and any existing data. Studies are then reviewed. If the review is favorable, the study receives an inprincipal acceptance and is registered in a repository. The research is then conducted.\nIn Stage II, researchers then submit completed manuscripts including:\n\nA justification for the work, and\nThe approved protocol from stage one and\nResults, discussion and any exploratory analysis.\n\nHow do you publish a registered report?\nPlan your study. Submit study proposal to a journal. The proposal will be reviewed. Receive and respond to any feedbackand then if accepted do the study and publish the final paper in the journal.\nWhy are registered reports important?\n\nThey put the focus on the research question and the methodological quality of the study.\nThey alleviate perceived pressures to obtain significant or exciting results and to publish.\nMany journals are starting to adopt registered reports as standard practice.\n\nComplete an activity on Canvas.
