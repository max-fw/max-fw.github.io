It also shows how open research can help us identify invalid results before they become the basis for bad clinical practice.\n\nFor example, during the pandemic, a trial was conducted to assess the use of hydroxychloricquin, an antimmalarial drug to treat severe CO 19. The study reported reduced mortality in patients who received the drug. As a result, hydroxychloricquin began to be touted as a ‘cure’.\n\nBut when a preprint of the study was published and other researchers began to review it, they identified a major flaw in the study design. This flaw likely affected the results. So the paper was withdrawn and hydroxychloricquin is not an approved treatment for Covid-19.",

In what ways does open research increase transparency and reproducibility of research outputs? By being very clear and outlining exactly what was done and how it was done. This can include clearly stating what, when, and or how archives or repositories were searched to identify research documents.\nIt could also include clearly outlining all steps in an experimental study and/or all the steps and statistical code used to analyze data.\nHow does open research increase transparency and reproducibility of research outputs? Open research also encourages researchers to share their data with other researchers.\nData is information collected, recorded, or created during the research process to validate research findings.\nData can be made available on online repositories. Open data helps other researchers to independently validate or attempt to reproduce the research.\nEnhanced accessibility and reusability of data\nWhat is open data? Open data is research data that anyone can use, access, and share.\nResearch data is information collected, generated, recorded, or used to validate or underpin the primary findings of a research project or study.\nData can exist in many formats like images, data sets, musical compositions, guidelines, multimedia, code, software, and more. Making data open and available is an important part of open research.\nWhat is open data?\nIn the past, open data has not been the norm. Technological developments have removed many of the barriers to sharing data.\nOpen data is not yet universal, but is increasingly standard practice. Open data requires a minimum standard of data quality to ensure its reusability. Adoption of minimum standards for open data is still in its infancy. But as the culture of open research grows, so too does the development of open data standards.\nHow does open data facilitate data accessibility and reusability?\n\nBy making data open, researchers are enhancing the reproducibility and transparency of their research outputs.\nMaking data open means data can be accessed by and presented to a larger audience.\nThe data can be reused by different researchers over time to answer new research questions.\nMaking data open can save time in data collection and maximizes research resources.\n\nLess poor research practices and greater research accountability\nHow does open research discourage poor research practices? Open research encourages researchers to publicly disclose the details of their methods. These can then be reviewed, assessed, and validated by other researchers. This may discourage use of questionable research practices.\nHow does open research help us identify methodological issues in research? The case of Covid 19. The Covid 19 pandemic provides a stark example of the ways poor research design can lead to poor outcomes. It also shows how open research can help us identify invalid results before they become the basis for bad clinical practice.\nFor example, during the pandemic, a trial was conducted to assess the use of hydroxychloricquin, an antimmalarial drug to treat severe CO 19. The study reported reduced mortality in patients who received the drug. As a result, hydroxychloricquin began to be touted as a cure.\nBut when a preprint of the study was published and other researchers began to review it, they identified a major flaw in the study design. This flaw likely affected the results. So the paper was withdrawn and hydroxychloricquin is not an approved treatment for Covid 19.\nIncreased opportunities for research collaboration\nHow does open research encourage collaboration? Open research enhances worldwide and interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers. This is facilitated by: 1. Open data whereby data of any kind is openly accessible. 2. Collaborative platforms for sharing information, tools, and resources.\nOpen research collaboration accelerates discovery and design by bringing together knowledge, tools, and expertise.\nHow does open research encourage collaboration, the case of Covid 19? During the pandemic, researchers from across the globe collaborated and shared data to better understand the disease and work towards preventive and treatment approaches.\nThere are also open research repositories dedicated specifically to Covid 19 research. For example, the World Economic Forum Global Science Collaboration Covid 19.\nImproved visibility of research findings\nHow does open research improve visibility and engagement with research?\nOpen research includes making final research products openly accessible. It can also include engaging in alternative ways of sharing research. This can increase the likelihood that research will be read and engaged with. Open research also tends to get more media attention, increasing visibility.\nHow does open research improve visibility and engagement with research?\nTake a look at this TEDex talk about memory to see how the speaker makes the research topic engaging and interesting.\nEncouragement of broader society participation in research\nHow does open research encourage societal participation in research?\nIncluding members of the public when conducting research is important for a number of reasons.\n\nIt enhances the relevance and impact of your research.\nIt helps to ensure fair access to knowledge and reduce inequalities.\nInclusion of the public in conducting research is called citizen research.\n\nHow does open research encourage societal participation in research?\n\nOpen research findings and outputs can be freely accessed by the public. This means there are no fees or need to use an institutional login.\nOpen research makes it easier for research to reach the public. This means people outside academia can engage with research outputs.\nIt is not just research papers that can be made freely available. Textbooks can be made openly available too. For example, via open textbook library.\n\nSharing of knowledge in open research also involves non-traditional roots including social media, public talks, blogs, visuals, and infographics. Using diverse approaches to share knowledge and research increases the likelihood that people can and will engage with it.\nTake a look at the next set of slides and/or recording to see why open research is important for you.\nWhy is open research important for me?\nWe come across research findings every day in the news, on television, and online. Having a better understanding of open research allows you to better engage with the research you read and hear about.\nUnderstanding good practices and spotting bad practices means you can judge how reliable and trustworthy a piece of research is.\nIf you go on to apply for a master’s or PhD funding, research funders increasingly require open research practices for grant applications.\nIf you decide to publish your project, many journals now encourage open practices, including registering studies in advance and sharing data.\nSome journals also award badges for open research practices.\nSharing your research also means it’s more likely to be read and or engaged with, meaning you have a greater chance of making an impact with your research.\nBy sharing drafts of research early, you can get feedback from researchers all over the world to help improve your research. This can be scary, but it can also be worth it.\nSharing data and research materials online also means they can be cited by other researchers because they are assigned digital object identifiers, DOIs.\nHow often your work is cited is an academic metric that is often used to decide on job opportunities and promotions.\nIf you use open research approaches, future prospective employers will be able to see your research outputs and processes. This can enhance your job applications, including outside research in academia.\nComplete the activity on Canvas to reflect on how your research goals and priorities align with the benefits of open research.",

Now that you have a sense of what open research is about in terms of the principles of open research, we will provide an introduction to using open research practices.\nPrinciples include transparency, reproducibility, accountability, collaboration, and societal engagement.\nPractices include research integrity, pre-registration, reproducible practices, research data management, open reporting, and knowledge dissemination.\nOpen research practices. Open research practices or methods are relevant at all stages of the research process, including research planning, data collection, data analysis, writing up and publishing findings, and disseminating and sharing your research.\nEach of the open research practices introduced here are discussed in the next sections.\nResearch integrity\nGuiding principles of research integrity.\nResearch integrity involves making honest and responsible decisions at all stages of the research cycle. It prioritizes reliability, ensuring quality of research at all stages of the research process, honesty, developing, conducting, sharing, and engaging with research in fair, transparent ways.\nRespect for research participants, colleagues, society, culture, and the environment. And accountability for the research, its management, and for wider impacts.\nWhy is research integrity important? 1. It reduces the likelihood of research misconduct. 2. It ensures the validity of research results. 3. It facilitates trust between researchers. 4. It promotes trust in data and research expertise.\nPre-registration\nA pre-registration is a record of research processes. It is created and shared before data are collected or become accessible. It is a timestamped record of decisions about study design, methods, and analysis. Pre-registration documents should be publicly available. There are dedicated repositories to make pre-registrations available.\nWhy is pre-registration important? 1. It encourages researchers to identify the goals of their project before collecting any data. 2. It creates accountability in research. 3. It discourages researchers from conducting after the-actalyses to find significant, novel, and or exciting results. 4. It makes research findings easier to find.\nOpen reporting\nResearch involves choices and revisions at each stage. Open reporting allows us to make our processes and our outputs transparent.\nOpen reporting involves providing a full, clear, and specific account of how research was conducted. It is supported by use of open reporting checklists.\nWhy is open reporting important?\n\nIt allows researchers to detail their processes and decisions at all stages of the research cycle.\nIt enhances other researchers ability to evaluate a study’s results.\nIt enhances other researchers abilities to reproduce a study’s results.\nIt benefits decision making at individual and societal levels because decisions can be made on transparent processes and findings.\n\nData management\nData is all information collected, observed, recorded or created throughout the research process. It can include spreadsheets, videos, audios, notes, diaries, images.\nData management. Research data management is the organization, storage and preservation of research data during active research and post project.\nA data management plan or DMP is a living document which describes the organization, storage, preservation and potential sharing of research data and is an integral part of open research practice.\nWhy is data management important?\n\nIt helps you keep track of your own work.\nIt protects against data loss.\nIt increases research efficiency.\nIt minimizes errors in data mission.\nThere are funding and publishing incentives related to data management.\nThere are institutional and/or legal data management requirements.\n\nWhy is open data important?\nRemember that open data is data made publicly available. 1. It enhances accountability. 2. It enhances transparency. 3. It enhances reproducibility. 4. It facilitates revisiting and building on existing data. 5. It facilitates better and stronger collaborations. 6. It is better value for the public money that funds much research.\nOpen knowledge dissemination\nOpen knowledge dissemination means communicating knowledge gained from research in open and accessible ways. This expands on the traditional approach to sharing research knowledge, which involves publishing it in an academic journal that can often only be accessed by paying a fee.\nApproaches to open knowledge dissemination include open access publishing. Anyone can access the published research without paying a fee. Preprints, versions of research papers made available online before being peer-reviewed and published. Repositories, databases people can use to store and access research papers and/or data sets.\nScience communication. sharing research in a way that increases appreciation, excitement, understanding and impact of research and data visualization representing data graphically or visually to increase its accessibility.\nWhy is open knowledge dissemination important?\n\nIt increases public access to and interest in research.\nIt increases the transparency and openness of research.\nIt helps reshape what is considered important in research and academia.\n\nFor the activity for this section, complete the activity on Canvas to reflect on where in the research cycle different open research practices are relevant.",

    "text": "What practices can compromise research integrity?\n\nPlagiarism, including self-plagiarism, giving or taking credit for work inappropriately.\nFabricating data, misrepresenting data, manipulation of images or other materials, undeclared conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat is plagiarism?\n\nPlagiarism is a practice of misrepresenting someone else’s words or ideas as your own. It is also possible to self-plagiarize.\nThis happens when an author passes off old work as new. For example, by submitting one paper for credit in two separate modules.\nHow do you avoid plagiarism?\n\n\nAlways acknowledge the work and contributions of other people.\nWhen paraphrasing or summarizing someone else’s work, include a citation.\nIf including text from someone else’s work verbatim, use quotation marks and include a citation.\nCite primary sources of information rather than secondary or tertiary sources.\n\n\nYour university will have resources to help you avoid plagiarism, too. In UCC, for example, a citing, referencing, and plagiarism course is available here.\nAnd check out this video on how to cite sources. And this one on examples of plagiarism. They are short but very useful.\nGiving or taking credit for work inappropriately\n\nIf someone makes a meaningful contribution to a research project, they should receive credit for their contribution. This might mean they are an author on a final paper or receive an acknowledgement on that paper.\nThere is guidance to determine if someone makes a meaningful contribution like the IC JME criteria.\n\nYou might also ask yourself, did they contribute to the study idea design? Did they conduct analyses or contribute to interpreting findings? Did they assist with writing up the final report paper?\n\nIf someone doesn’t make a meaningful contribution, they shouldn’t be given credit. For instance, listing uninvolved members of a research group or more senior academics who only looked at the final paper. These kind of authors are sometimes called ghost authors.\n\n\nData fabrication\n\nData fabrication is a process of manufacturing or making up data. For example, an anthropologist might write transcripts of interviews they never conducted. These transcripts, false data, might become part of the research record.\nThis can result in unreliable data and waste research resources through attempted replications.\nCovid 19 example\n\nA paper published in 2020 reported increased risk of debt for people hospitalized with Covid 19 if they had underlying cardiovascular disease.\n\nFindings were based on data supposedly collected by the company of one of the study authors. It quickly became apparent that the data was fraudulent. The paper was retracted, but such questionable practices can undermine trust in research.\n\n\nData misrepresentation\n\nData misrepresentation is a practice of presenting real data in a misleading way. Researchers might emphasize exciting or novel findings only. Researchers might also distort or duplicate images of their findings.\nSome researchers even magnified or reverse their images to try and avoid detection.\n\nData misrepresentation gives an incomplete picture of the research findings. Like other questionable research practices, it can result in unreliable data. It can also waste research resources through attempted replications.\nPiracy and manipulation of images, other materials\n\nSometimes researchers manipulate figures, images, or other resources to include them in multiple research papers. Often these manipulated materials come from organizations known as paper mills.\n\nPaper mills turn out fake data, images, and whole papers to meet demand from researchers. But there are also researchers working to identify this manipulated content so it can be retracted.\n\n\nUndeclared conflicts of interest\n\nA conflict of interest is when a researcher’s other interests lead to intentional or unintentional biases in research.\nConflicts of interest may in turn compromise the validity of the results.\n\nFor example, a researcher receiving funding for pharmaceutical development may be incentivized to demonstrate that competitors drugs are unsafe or inferior. This may shape how they conduct their research and impact the findings which will influence people’s health and care in the future.\nWhy do people engage in research misconduct?\n\nThere are several factors that can motivate research misconduct. Some are emotional like fear of failure. Misconduct may also be motivated by external pressures like pressure from supervisors to achieve a certain result.\nResearchers may also feel pressure to perform due to the competitiveness of academic culture. Worries about personal circumstances like employment status might also motivate misconduct.",

And what if I want to change my research plan?\n\nYour pre-registration is the research plan you will put together with your supervisor and or for ethics approval. So you will be doing much of the work anyway. There are lots of resources and templates you can use to pre-register. This makes it much easier.\n\nYou can also update your pre-registration up until you begin data analysis. Your pre-registration will outline how you plan to conduct your study and can be amended up to a point.\n\nOkay, sounds good. So, how do I actually do it?\n\nTo pre-register your study, you need to decide the following in advance: your study design and methods, how you will collect your data, and how you will analyze your data.\n\n\nYou should have a clear plan including all the relevant information and details.\nYou then need to decide where you are going to pre-register your study.\nDifferent pre-registration platforms will provide templates for pre-registering your study.\nTemplates are meant to serve as a guide because pre-registration may require some flexibility.\n\n\nDifferent disciplines may require different methods for pre-registration. A list of discipline specific templates is included in the Additional Resources section. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other applicable templates.\n\nPre-registering on OSF\n\nOSF Open Science Framework is a popular repository or platform for pre-registering projects. For this reason, paper trail focuses on OSF for pre-registration.\nPre-registering on OSF\n\nA complete guide to pre-registering projects on OSF is available on their website here. A brief overview is presented on the next slide.\nRemember, another platform may be more suitable for you, but for this course, we are just focusing on OSF.\nHere are the steps to pre-register on OSF\n\n\nSet up an account on the Open Science Framework.\nSelect to start a new pre-registration.\nInclude your project title and a description. This is called your metadata.\nInclude your research plan. This is your research design or approach and how you will collect and analyze data.\nRegister it and make it public. You can make it immediately public or public at a later date.\nPreview and review your pre-registration.\nYou can add attachments if you need more space or have additional components to share.\n\nPre-registering on OSF, the finished project\n\nOn screen is an OSF pre-registration study protocol of the study factors that impact on the practice of open science by early career health researchers, a mixed method study.

It sounds like a lot of work. And what if I want to change my research plan?\nPre-registering your study. Your pre-registration is the research plan you will put together with your supervisor and or for ethics approval. So you will be doing much of the work anyway. There are lots of resources and templates you can use to pre-register. This makes it much easier.\nPre-registering your study. You can also update your pre-registration up until you begin data analysis. Your pre-registration will outline how you plan to conduct your study and can be amended up to a point.\nOkay, sounds good. So, how do I actually do it?\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nTo pre-register your study, you need to decide the following in advance. Your study design and methods, how you will collect your data, and how you will analyze your data.\nHow do you pre-register a study?\n\nYou should have a clear plan including all the relevant information and details.\nYou then need to decide where you are going to pre-register your study.\nDifferent pre-registration platforms will provide templates for pre-registering your study.\nTemplates are meant to serve as a guide because pre-registration may require some flexibility.\n\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nDifferent disciplines may require different methods for pre-registration. A list of discipline specific templates is included in the additional resources section. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other applicable templates.\nPre-registering on OSF.\nOSF Open Science Framework is a popular repository or platform for pre-registering projects. For this reason, paper trail focuses on OSF for pre-registration.\nPre-registering on OSF. A complete guide to pre-registering projects on OSF is available on their website here. A brief overview is presented on the next slide.\nRemember, another platform may be more suitable for you, but for this course, we are just focusing on OSF.\nPre-registering on OSF.\n\nSet up an account on the Open Science Framework.\nSelect to start a new pre-registration.\nInclude your project title and a description. This is called your metadata.\nInclude your research plan. This is your research design or approach and how you will collect and analyze data.\nRegister it and make it public. You can make it immediately public or public at a later date.\nPreview and review your pre-registration.\nYou can add attachments if you need more space or have additional components to share.\n\nPre-registering on OSF, the finished project.\nOn screen is an OSF pre-registration study protocol of the study factors that impact on the practice of open science by early career health researchers, a mixed method study. The full pre-registration of this study is included in the resources for your reference.\nWhat is a registered report?\nTypically, when we want to publish a paper, we submit it to a journal after the study is finished. The journal and its peer reviewers then decide if the study can be published in that journal.\nThere is evidence that studies with significant novel or exciting findings are more likely to get published.\nWhat are registered reports?\n\nRegistered reports are research papers outlining the proposed study methods and approach.\nThe potential for publication of these papers is evaluated by the journal before any data collection.\nThis means they are evaluating the proposed study methods rather than the findings.\n\nWhat is a Registered Report?\nStage I\nResearchers submit their research question, questions, theory, hypothesis, detailed methods, analysis plans, and any existing data. Studies are then reviewed. If the review is favorable, the study receives an inprincipal acceptance and is registered in a repository. The research is then conducted.\nIn Stage II, researchers then submit completed manuscripts including:\n\nA justification for the work, and\nThe approved protocol from stage one and\nResults, discussion and any exploratory analysis.\n\nHow do you publish a registered report?\nPlan your study. Submit study proposal to a journal. The proposal will be reviewed. Receive and respond to any feedbackand then if accepted do the study and publish the final paper in the journal.\nWhy are registered reports important?\n\nThey put the focus on the research question and the methodological quality of the study.\nThey alleviate perceived pressures to obtain significant or exciting results and to publish.\nMany journals are starting to adopt registered reports as standard practice.\n\nComplete an activity on Canvas.

This is because reproducibility does not equal truth. But lack of reproducibility does raise questions about a study’s validity and reliability.\nReproducibility can also be understood as:\nReproducible research involves sharing data and research procedures, making these available for public peer evaluation, taking steps in the study design process to minimize bias.\nReproducibility across disciplines\nThe concept of reproducibility was developed in science and is primarily oriented around quantitative data. It has traditionally focused on how we can go from a dataset, visualize the information, and demonstrate the analyses that are applied, all of which can be achieved using reproducible scripted workflows.\nSo reproducibility may reflect scientific assumptions that do not translate easily to other disciplines.\nSo what about qualitative research, and our research conducted in the social sciences, arts, and the humanities? Exact data replication may not be possible or even advantageous in some cases. Ethical commitments may prevent the sharing of complete datasets.\nThe amount and kinds of data that can be disclosed in qualitative and social research may depend on a variety of factors: the relationship between researcher and participant, sample characteristics, the research setting, the information being documented, for example, interview data.\nThere are still approaches that can be taken in non-science disciplines. This type of research should prioritize transparency by providing details about how the research was conducted.\n“Crisis” versus “Renaissance”\nThere is an argument that what is currently being described as a reproducibility crisis is actually a renaissance in that the focus on reproducibility has highlighted existing problems and proposes ways to address them.\nThis is resulting in new ways of thinking about and conducting research, and is leading to improvements in research.",

Through the incorporation of reproducible practices within our work, we can identify and correct these mistakes after the event, improving the quality of our reporting. Check out the next four slides for examples.\n\nExample 1. Identifying reproducibility issues in a clinical trial.\nClinical trials are studies that examine, typically, treatments on human health outcomes. In 2018, a major medical journal retracted an important clinical trial after a serious error was detected in how the trial data was processed.\n\nIn this trial, the treatment and control groups had their coding reversed. This means that what the researchers thought was data from the treatment group was actually data from the control group and vice versa.\n\nThis was an inadvertent mistake that invalidated the trial results. The mistake was only found because the code underlying the results was published and so could be examined. Someone who examined the code spotted the mistake. In this way, reproducible research practices saved the day.\n\nExample 2. Power Posing\nIn 2010, researchers published results from a psychological study suggesting that power posing, or standing or adopting an assertive posture, can improve confidence. These findings were disseminated widely, and the concept of power posing quickly found its way into popular culture.\n\nTwo years later, however, the results of the study were called into question when a replication study failed to find the same results. This was particularly the case for changes that the original researchers had reported for certain hormones as a result of power posing.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny of the original research revealed that the statistical significance values associated with the work were barely significant.\n\nThe research was, for a time, dismissed as pseudoscience. However, preregistered and robust replication studies have supported that power posing is linked to people’s feelings of confidence now. This reaffirms a link between posture and confidence. It also demonstrates the importance of being able to reproduce studies to determine potentially erroneous and/or valid findings.",

It can make research better by reducing bias and/or teasing out other flaws in research. The assessors or markers of your final research project can see how thorough and transparent you have been. While reproducibility practices may take a bit more of your time, they pay off in the end!\n\nIf you want to publish your research, journals are now publishing more reproduction studies and negative results.\nBeing able to assess published research for reproducibility gives you a better understanding of what research is reliable (or not).\n\nIt also helps develop a more reliable evidence base for policy or practice decisions that impact society.",

    "text": "How do we make research more reproducible?\nWhat kinds of things decrease reproducibility?\n\nThere are lots of things that can impact on reproducibility, things like flaws in study design, researcher biases, and misunderstanding analytical approaches.\n\nReproducibility may also be decreased by poor record keeping, mistakes, and lack of training, as well as poor sharing of research approaches, selective reporting of findings and methods, and incentives to publish more and faster at the cost of rigor.\nHow can we make research more reliable and reproducible?\n\n\nCarefully document your methods using a data management plan.\nUse a uniform filing system with clear folder and filing names.\nStore metadata alongside the primary data. Metadata is data about data.\nStore all research materials in accordance with institutional guidelines.\nConsider keeping a digital notebook to share processes and steps used to generate findings.\n\nHow can we make research more reliable and reproducible?\n\nIf you are working with data that can be more readily made available, make your data and details of methods freely available to other researchers by publishing the data in a repository such as OSF, which you were introduced to in module two. Always including a data dictionary to accompany your data. A data dictionary gives clear information about your data. Using open-sourced software and providing information about statistical tests or other analytical approaches employed and the arguments used.\n\nIn some disciplines, it’s not as easy or possible to make data available. If it is not possible, remember the importance of enhancing transparency by providing details about how the research was conducted. These details can include the theoretical method adopted, the research setting, the relationship between researcher and participants, anonymized patient characteristics.\n\nStrategies to make your research more reproducible are presented throughout the PaportTrail course: Research Integrity, Research Data Management, Open Reporting, Knowledge Dissemination.\n\nThere are resources available to help. Examples of resources in University College Cork include a digital badge in the responsible conduct of research that includes training on research reproducibility.\nThere are post-graduate modules on reproducible research Practices, PG6030, and an Introduction to Research Integrity, Ethics, and Open Science, PG6015.\nThe UCC Boole Library also run a variety of training sessions. Other universities may have supports including training and workshops to support you to develop reproducible research methods.\n\nThere are also online networks and communities you can follow and join. For example, the UK Reproducibility Network, UKRN.\n\nThe UKRN provides guidance and resources for methods and strategies for improving research reproducibility.\nReproducibility for Everyone, this provides resources and webinars on strategies for reproducible research.\nReproducibiliTea, a community for early-stage researchers interested in open science and reproducibility.\n\nWhat efforts are universities and supervisors making to help us make research more reproducible?\n\nEfforts are increasing by supervisors and universities to support students.\n\nOne example of this, being led by Dr. Katherine Button, the University of Bath, is a collaborative approach to open research projects. In this model, students in a number of UK universities participate in a consortium to complete their final-year theses. The students receive extra support throughout the project to make their research reproducible.",

    "text": "Why is Open Reporting Important?\n\nTraditionally, research reports place an emphasis on results, which has meant that other parts of the research process remain opaque. This limits other researchers’ abilities to evaluate or attempt to reproduce a study’s results. If flaws go undetected, invalid research results may still become part of the research record.\nThis may increase research waste as other researchers attempt to reproduce or build upon flawed evidence. It may also unduly impact both individual decisions and social policy.\n\n\nIt allows researchers to detail their processes and decisions at all stages of the research cycle.\nIt enhances other researchers’ ability to evaluate and/or verify a study’s results.\nIt enhances other researchers’ ability to reproduce a study’s results.\nIt facilitates researchers’ ability to bring together large bodies of evidence to better understand topics.\nIt benefits decision-making because decisions can be made on transparent research processes and findings.\n\nWhy is open reporting important for me?\n\nThat all sounds great for research more generally, but what about me as a student? It sounds like it takes extra time, and I’m not sure how I will benefit. By openly reporting what you have done in your research, you have a transparent account of your study.\n\nThis makes it easier for others, including your research supervisor, to see the steps you have taken.

You can find out more about pre-registration and registered reports in the module on Pre-registration.\nWhat is a reporting guideline?\n\nIt is the checklist, a structured text, or a flow diagram that guides researchers in how to report a specific type of research that has been developed using explicit methodology.\n\nWhat is the aim of a reporting guideline?\n\nTo help researchers create accessible and easily understood records of their research.\nTo help researchers create relevant records of their research.\nTo help researchers create records of their work containing sufficient detail to allow evaluation and/or reproduction.\n\nReporting guidelines and checklists\n\nWhen should I use an open reporting checklist? They are typically used when writing research reports and articles. Many journals now require you to submit a completed checklist with your submitted paper.\nYou can also use the checklists to guide your thinking and drafting of your protocol and/or ethics application.\n\nReporting guidelines and checklists are also useful to guide your process as well as essential to complete when writing up your final report. So how do I find a reporting guideline for my research, and how do I know which one is the right one to use?\nThere are resources you can use like the EQUATOR Network website. This has a list of guidelines you can use, and many are available in many different languages.",

    "text": "What is the traditional approach to knowledge dissemination?\n⏭️ Skip ahead to watch the video presentation 📊 or see the slides\nWhat is open knowledge dissemination?\nDissemination is the term used to describe how research is shared. It includes the processes researchers use to share research with other researchers and the general public.\nTo understand what open dissemination is, it is helpful to first think about how dissemination of research has typically been conducted. Traditional dissemination consisted of the steps outlined in the next slide.\nHow is research typically disseminated?\nStep 1. Designing and conducting research.\nStep 2. Analysing data and generating results.\nStep 3. Writing up the research findings in the form of a journal article and submitting this for publication in an academic journal.\nStep 4. The study undergoes peer review, and a decision is made about whether the article can be accepted, needs to be revised or is rejected.\nStep 5. Eventually the article will be published on the Journal website and or in print.\nWhat are some of the challenges of traditional knowledge dissemination?\nSo paywalls and barriers to accessing knowledge also impact on transparency of research. And if research is not disseminated transparently, it can’t be learnt from and or built upon.\nAnother problem is that the traditional processes may be biased towards publishing novel, exciting and or significant results. This is a phenomenon known as the file drawer problem. It means that only some findings are available which can bias our understanding and means we only have an incomplete picture.\nWhat are some of the challenges of traditional knowledge dissemination?\nIt is also a big problem because it can influence which questions researchers choose to ask. So research becomes focussed on what researchers can get published rather than on what we should be examining.\nIt can also incentivise researchers to engage in questionable research or reporting practises to produce novel, exciting and or significant results.",

Open access publishing\n2. Preprint\n3. Online repositories\n4. Science communication\n5. Citizen science\nWe will take you through these and the following module sections.\nPotential obstacles to open research dissemination\n\nMaking research papers openly available involves fees that researchers must pay. This is not always possible.\nSome forms of open knowledge dissemination do not require research to be peer reviewed and checked. This may lead to dissemination of lower quality research, however, the challenges of monitoring quality of openly disseminated research may be balanced by increased transparency and post publication peer review. It is also increasingly clear that traditional approaches to dissemination do not also ensure quality either.\nActivity 1",

    "text": "Open Access Publishing\nWhat is open access publishing?\n\nOpen access publishing means publishing research in a format so that it is made openly available for anyone to read without any cost to the reader. There are many dedicated open access journals where people can publish their research openly. There are also increasing numbers of journals offering an open access publishing option in addition to the standard publishing approach. Research funders are increasingly requiring funded researchers to publish their findings open access.\n\nOpen access publishing has costs for the researcher, though, who usually has to pay fees to make their research openly available.\nThis is a barrier to open publishing. It also reflects a bigger problem of costs in publishing, either way, that public money funds research, but there are always costs involved for the public to be able to access.\n\nThere are other approaches like preprint that can help get around these issues. We’ll discuss these soon.\nBenefits of open access\n\n\nIt is easier for everyone, including you, to access research if it is published as open access.\nOpen access publishing allows citizens to share in knowledge and evidence on issues that affects them.\n\n\n\nOpen access publications can increase exposure and impact of your research.\nOpen access publications are reported to receive more media coverage.\n\n\n\nA lot of research is funded by public money awarded through grants, so open access makes sure the public can see what they have funded.\n\nHow do I make my research open access?\n\nIf you go on to publish your research project, you can consider publishing it in an open access publication. The directory of open access journals provides a list of such journals across multiple disciplines.\n\nRemember, though, that open access publications have costs for you as the researcher submitting the paper. You can often apply for open access fee waivers, especially for student work that is not supported by funding. Waivers are not always granted, though, so open access publishing may not always be possible due to cost.",

They are the same manuscript that will be submitted to a journal, so they represent the final work.\nAre men who smoke at higher risk for more severe case of Covid-19 than women who smoke? A systematic review.\nThis is an example of a preprint published by students and their supervisor from UCC.\nBenefits and drawbacks to preprint\n\nUploading a pre-print of your manuscript allows for free and rapid dissemination of your research. When reading reprints, it is important to remember that they have not been peer reviewed and so should be read with a degree of caution.\n\nWhile many journals now have policies allowing and encouraging preconceive research articles, some do not accept preprint. There are ways to check which journals do and don’t accept preference. We talk more about this shortly.\nHow do I do a preprint?\n\nIf you are planning to publish your research project, you can upload a copy of the final manuscript to a pre-print server. You must do this before you submit it to a journal for peer review.\n\nOK, but how do I actually prepare my manuscript and find where to upload it? An important first step is talking to your supervisor about making your research available as a pre-print.\n\nYou should then identify a suitable preprint server. Some examples are archived bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv. You can see examples of preference on any of the above servers to help guide you in preparing to upload your preprint.\nAs your preprint is the same manuscript that you will submit to the journal. Any changes to your manuscript will mostly be formatting and uploading requirements.\n\nIt is very important to check that the journal you want to publish your manuscript in accepts prints, share Borromeo provides up to date information about individual journals, open access policies. So check here first.\n\nOnce you are sure your target journal accept preprints, you have identified a relevant preprint server and have prepared your paper, you can upload it to the pre-print server.",

Researchers have control over what is made publicly available when putting data or outputs on repositories.\n\n\nRepositories can be domain or discipline specific or maybe more general.\nExamples of domain specific repositories, Leanness, Health Research, Emelle, a core humanities Izidor, social sciences and humanities.\nExamples of more general repositories, open science framework and Xanadu.\n\n\nTo upload your research paper, manuscript or data, you must first identify an appropriate repository. Once you have identified a repository, follow the repository guidance to upload your paper or data.\nAn important note on uploading data to a repository\n\nIf you were uploading data to an online repository, make sure you are adhering to ethical considerations and data sharing guidelines.\nYou should complete the PaporTrail module on Research and Data Management to find out more about this. You should also consult your institutional research and data sharing guidelines and support services.\n\nThe OSFI allows researchers to:\n1) Store and make available their research outputs\n2) manage their workflows and keep projects organised\n3) store data analyses and reports\n4) assign a digital object identifier to their project\n5) link projects to researcher.",

It can incorporate a range of different approaches aimed at the target audience, including the wider community or special interest groups, e.g. policymaker’s blogs, public talks and images.\n\nApproaches can include things like public talks, e.g., point of science, social media, including using GIFs, check, hashtag, a bit of cake for good examples of student research.\nBlog posts like this one about personalised medicine, videos using visuals or infographics, podcasts like the Orion Open Science Podcast and newspapers and the media.\n\nBenefits of Science Communication\n\n\nIt enhances the sharing of research findings.\nIt increases public understanding of research.\nIt increases public interest in research and for it can help research to make an impact by reaching target audiences.\n\nHow do I do science communication if you aren’t ready to share your research with the public?\n\nYes, a good starting place with science communication is to see how other people are doing is.\n\nThere are likely blogs relevant to your discipline or research interests that you could look at.\n\n\n\nGraphical abstracts, which visually represent the research, are becoming increasingly common in journal publications.\nThere are thousands of TED and TED talks, which you can watch Twitter threads, YouTube and other social media include examples of science communication too.\n\n\n\nThere are also local, national and international activities you can attend. Your university may have events and competitions like a three minute thesis where researchers present their research in three minutes.\n\n\n\nOther activities include things like point of science, where researchers present their research in a pub setting Fame Lab, which is an international science communication competition for researchers, including research students.\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to share your research, you might want to take part in some of these activities.\nWhen you are ready to share your research with the public, it is important to first identify who your target audience is. Is it everyone or is it a specific group that your research is most relevant to?\n\nThink about what message or messages you want to share, what are the key findings, the things that are most important for your audience to know?\nThink about ways that you can share this information.\nThere are lots of options like in-person talks or using videos, visual representations, podcasts or blog posts.\n\nIt is important that you avoid using technical terms or jargon when sharing your research with the public, you want it to be accessible to everyone.\nTry to include visuals as well as speaking text, this can maintain attention and keep it interesting for the audience.\nHow do I do science communication?\n\nMake it relatable. Remember, you are not communicating as a researcher to other researchers, so only include examples and anecdotes that are relatable to your target audience.\n\nRemember that because science communication aims for exclusivity, it can be difficult for the audience to decide what is reliable information.\nIf you were doing science communication, be sure to support your points with accessible data and or supporting information.\nIf you are viewing science communication, put your researcher hat on to determine if the communicator is supporting their points.",

They are instead active research partners.\n\nBenefits of citizen science\n\nIt promotes research that is conducted for the people and by the people. It enhances public engagement in and with research. It nurtures public investment in an understanding of scientific processes and outputs.\nCase study: The people’s trial\n\nCheck out the people’s trial for an excellent example of citizen science and science, communication and action. The public were involved in all stages of the project from deciding what research question to examine, to deciding how the findings should be shared.\n\nFor example, the public were asked to come up with possible research questions, they came up with 155 questions.\n\nThe public then voted on which one they should examine, the question they decided on was: Does reading a book in bed make a difference to sleep in comparison to not reading a book in bed?\n\nThis video was used to explain the what, why and how of deciding a research question.\nFind out more about the people’s trial by visiting their website.\n\nCitizen science is a bit trickier to include in a student project. You can get involved in ongoing citizen science projects that you come across.

Dissemination is the term used to describe how research is shared. It includes the processes researchers use to share research with other researchers and the general public.\nTo understand what open dissemination is, it is helpful to first think about how dissemination of research has typically been conducted. Traditional dissemination consisted of the steps outlined in the next slide.\nHow is research typically disseminated? Step 1. Designing and conducting research. Step 2. Analysing data and generating results. Step 3. Writing up the research findings in the form of a journal article and submitting this for publication in an academic journal. Step 4. The study undergoes peer review, and a decision is made about whether the article can be accepted, needs to be revised or is rejected. Step 5. Eventually the article will be published on the Journal website and or in print.\nWhat are some of the challenges of traditional knowledge dissemination? - It can take a long time for researchers to get their findings published and for anyone interested to be able to read them. - Articles in traditional journals are often behind paywalls, which means they can only be accessed by paying a subscription or fee. This makes it harder for people to access the information, you’ve probably already encountered this as a student. - In addition, institutions may subscribe to journals, but not all institutions can afford the same fees. This can create and reinforce inequalities in access to knowledge.\nSo paywalls and barriers to accessing knowledge also impact on transparency of research. And if research is not disseminated transparently, it can’t be learnt from and or built upon.\nAnother problem is that the traditional processes may be biased towards publishing novel, exciting and or significant results. This is a phenomenon known as the file drawer problem. It means that only some findings are available which can bias our understanding and means we only have an incomplete picture.\nWhat are some of the challenges of traditional knowledge dissemination? It is also a big problem because it can influence which questions researchers choose to ask. So research becomes focussed on what researchers can get published rather than on what we should be examining.\nIt can also incentivise researchers to engage in questionable research or reporting practises to produce novel, exciting and or significant results.\nWhat is open knowledge dissemination?\n\nIt involves sharing research more quickly and openly than in a traditional approach.\nIt includes approaches that can reduce inequalities by sharing information and broader, more accessible ways.\nIt is not only open access publishing, although this is an important component.\n\nMethods for openly disseminating research 1. Open access publishing 2. Preprint 3. Online repositories 4. Science communication 5. Citizen science\nWe will take you through these and the following module sections.\nPotential obstacles to open research dissemination\nMaking research papers openly available involves fees that researchers must pay. This is not always possible.\nSome forms of open knowledge dissemination do not require research to be peer reviewed and checked. This may lead to dissemination of lower quality research, however, the challenges of monitoring quality of openly disseminated research may be balanced by increased transparency and post publication peer review. It is also increasingly clear that traditional approaches to dissemination do not also ensure quality either.",

It’s created in advance, created and shared before data are collected or become accessible and made publicly available. The pre-registration document should be publicly available on a registry or repository.\nHow is this different to an ethics application? For many research projects, you will need to submit an ethics application. This is typical for studies involving people, existing data, and in the sciences.\nHow is a pre-registration different to an ethics application? Pre-registrations and ethics applications contain much of the same information, but they serve different aims.\nWhy is pre-registration important?\n\nIt encourages researchers to identify the goals of their project before collecting data or starting analysis.\nIt creates accountability in research.\nIt discourages researchers from conducting after the fact analyses to find significant, novel, or exciting results.\nIt helps researchers manage the personal biases that might influence their research.\nIt makes research findings easier to locate.\n\nWhy should you pre-register your study?\nPre-registration is easy once you’ve learned how to do it. It builds your reputation as a researcher and allows you to take credit for your ideas and plans. You may also be able to earn a digital badge for pre-registering your study. These are offered by over 60 research journals in multiple disciplines.\nWhy aren’t all studies pre-registered?\nPre-registration might present challenges for some types of research like exploratory research or secondary analysis. But challenges do not mean it can’t be done.\nWhy aren’t all studies pre-registered? Pre-registration takes time, planning, and figuring out requirements for pre-registration for the target repository.\nSome researchers think pre-registration is not applicable or appropriate for more constructivist research. But being transparent about what we plan to do before we begin our research projects is important for any type of research.\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nPre-registering your study. It sounds like a lot of work. And what if I want to change my research plan?\nPre-registering your study. Your pre-registration is the research plan you will put together with your supervisor and or for ethics approval. So you will be doing much of the work anyway. There are lots of resources and templates you can use to pre-register. This makes it much easier.\nPre-registering your study. You can also update your pre-registration up until you begin data analysis. Your pre-registration will outline how you plan to conduct your study and can be amended up to a point.\nOkay, sounds good. So, how do I actually do it?\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nTo pre-register your study, you need to decide the following in advance. Your study design and methods, how you will collect your data, and how you will analyze your data.\nHow do you pre-register a study?\n\nYou should have a clear plan including all the relevant information and details.\nYou then need to decide where you are going to pre-register your study.\nDifferent pre-registration platforms will provide templates for pre-registering your study.\nTemplates are meant to serve as a guide because pre-registration may require some flexibility.\n\nHow do you pre-register a study?\nDifferent disciplines may require different methods for pre-registration. A list of discipline specific templates is included in the additional resources section. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other applicable templates.\nPre-registering on OSF.\nOSF Open Science Framework is a popular repository or platform for pre-registering projects. For this reason, paper trail focuses on OSF for pre-registration.\nPre-registering on OSF. A complete guide to pre-registering projects on OSF is available on their website here. A brief overview is presented on the next slide.\nRemember, another platform may be more suitable for you, but for this course, we are just focusing on OSF.\nPre-registering on OSF.\n\nSet up an account on the Open Science Framework.\nSelect to start a new pre-registration.\nInclude your project title and a description. This is called your metadata.\nInclude your research plan. This is your research design or approach and how you will collect and analyze data.\nRegister it and make it public. You can make it immediately public or public at a later date.\nPreview and review your pre-registration.\nYou can add attachments if you need more space or have additional components to share.\n\nPre-registering on OSF, the finished project.\nOn screen is an OSF pre-registration study protocol of the study factors that impact on the practice of open science by early career health researchers, a mixed method study. The full pre-registration of this study is included in the resources for your reference.\nWhat is a registered report?\nTypically, when we want to publish a paper, we submit it to a journal after the study is finished. The journal and its peer reviewers then decide if the study can be published in that journal.\nThere is evidence that studies with significant novel or exciting findings are more likely to get published.\nWhat are registered reports?\n\nRegistered reports are research papers outlining the proposed study methods and approach.\nThe potential for publication of these papers is evaluated by the journal before any data collection.\nThis means they are evaluating the proposed study methods rather than the findings.\n\nWhat is a Registered Report?\nStage I\nResearchers submit their research question, questions, theory, hypothesis, detailed methods, analysis plans, and any existing data. Studies are then reviewed. If the review is favorable, the study receives an inprincipal acceptance and is registered in a repository. The research is then conducted.\nIn Stage II, researchers then submit completed manuscripts including:\n\nA justification for the work, and\nThe approved protocol from stage one and\nResults, discussion and any exploratory analysis.\n\nHow do you publish a registered report?\nPlan your study. Submit study proposal to a journal. The proposal will be reviewed. Receive and respond to any feedbackand then if accepted do the study and publish the final paper in the journal.\nWhy are registered reports important?\n\nThey put the focus on the research question and the methodological quality of the study.\nThey alleviate perceived pressures to obtain significant or exciting results and to publish.\nMany journals are starting to adopt registered reports as standard practice.\n\nComplete an activity on Canvas. There are three to choose from depending on what research stage you are currently at. You must complete at least one activity, but you can complete more if you like.",

This is because reproducibility does not equal truth. But lack of reproducibility does raise questions about a study’s validity and reliability.\nWhat is research reproducibility?\nReproducibility can also be understood as:\n\nMethods reproducibility. Enough information is provided about the study methods for it to be repeated.\nResults reproducibility. An independent study obtains the same results using the original methods.\nInferential reproducibility. Similar conclusions are reached from replicated findings. Reproducible research practices.\n\nReproducible research involves sharing data and research procedures, making these available for public peer evaluation, taking steps in the study design process to minimize bias.\nReproducibility across disciplines\nThe concept of reproducibility was developed in science and is primarily oriented around quantitative data. It has traditionally focused on how we can go from a dataset, visualize the information, and demonstrate the analyses that are applied, all of which can be achieved using reproducible scripted workflows.\nSo reproducibility may reflect scientific assumptions that do not translate easily to other disciplines. Reproducibility across disciplines. So what about qualitative research, and our research conducted in the social sciences, arts, and the humanities? Exact data replication may not be possible or even advantageous in some cases. Ethical commitments may prevent the sharing of complete datasets.\nThe amount and kinds of data that can be disclosed in qualitative and social research may depend on a variety of factors: the relationship between researcher and participant, sample characteristics, the research setting, the information being documented, for example, interview data.\nThere are still approaches that can be taken in non-science disciplines. This type of research should prioritize transparency by providing details about how the research was conducted. Crisis versus renaissance. There is an argument that what is currently being described as a reproducibility crisis is actually a renaissance in that the focus on reproducibility has highlighted existing problems and proposes ways to address them. This is resulting in new ways of thinking about and conducting research, and is leading to improvements in research.\nReproducibility examples\nTo err is to be human.\nOften, the mistakes made inadvertently lie hidden, never to be found. Through the incorporation of reproducible practices within our work, we can identify and correct these mistakes after the event, improving the quality of our reporting. Check out the next four slides for examples.\nExample one, identifying reproducibility issues in a clinical trial.\nClinical trials are studies that examine, typically, treatments on human health outcomes. In 2018, a major medical journal retracted an important clinical trial after a serious error was detected in how the trial data was processed.\nExample one, identifying reproducibility issues in a clinical trial.\nIn this trial, the treatment and control groups had their coding reversed. This means that what the researchers thought was data from the treatment group was actually data from the control group and vice versa.\nExample one, identifying reproducibility issues in a clinical trial. This was an inadvertent mistake that invalidated the trial results. The mistake was only found because the code underlying the results was published and so could be examined. Someone who examined the code spotted the mistake. In this way, reproducible research practices saved the day.\nExample two, power posing. In 2010, researchers published results from a psychological study suggesting that power posing, or standing or adopting an assertive posture, can improve confidence. These findings were disseminated widely, and the concept of power posing quickly found its way into popular culture.\nTwo years later, however, the results of the study were called into question when a replication study failed to find the same results. This was particularly the case for changes that the original researchers had reported for certain hormones as a result of power posing.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny of the original research revealed that the statistical significance values associated with the work were barely significant.\nThe research was, for a time, dismissed as pseudoscience. However, preregistered and robust replication studies have supported that power posing is linked to people’s feelings of confidence now. This reaffirms a link between posture and confidence. It also demonstrates the importance of being able to reproduce studies to determine potentially erroneous and/or valid findings.\nWhy is reproducibility important?\n\nIt ensures research can be assessed, verified, and confirmed by other researchers.\nIt helps identify and correct situations where researchers have engaged in questionable research practices.\nCreating a culture of reproducibility can discourage researchers from reporting only those findings that are significant or exciting.\n\nHow does this impact you?\nEngaging in reproducible practices minimizes the likelihood of questionable research practices, no matter what discipline you are in. It can make research better by reducing bias and/or teasing out other flaws in research. The assessors or markers of your final research project can see how thorough and transparent you have been. While reproducibility practices may take a bit more of your time, they pay off in the end.\nIf you want to publish your research, journals are now publishing more reproduction studies and negative results.\nBeing able to assess published research for reproducibility gives you a better understanding of what research is reliable or not.\nIt also helps develop a more reliable evidence base for policy or practice decisions that impact society.\nHow do we make research more reproducible?\nWhat kinds of things decrease reproducibility? There are lots of things that can impact on reproducibility, things like flaws in study design, researcher biases, and misunderstanding analytical approaches. What kinds of things decrease reproducibility?\nReproducibility may also be decreased by poor record keeping, mistakes, and lack of training, as well as poor sharing of research approaches, selective reporting of findings and methods, and incentives to publish more and faster at the cost of rigor. How can we make research more reliable and reproducible?\nCarefully document your methods using a data management plan. Use a uniform filing system with clear folder and filing names. Store metadata alongside the primary data. Metadata is data about data. Store all research materials in accordance with institutional guidelines. Consider keeping a digital notebook to share processes and steps used to generate findings.\nHow can we make research more reliable and reproducible?\nIf you are working with data that can be more readily made available, make your data and details of methods freely available to other researchers by publishing the data in a repository such as OSF, which you were introduced to in module two. Always including a data dictionary to accompany your data. A data dictionary gives clear information about your data. Using open-sourced software and providing information about statistical tests or other analytical approaches employed and the arguments used.\nIn some disciplines, it’s not as easy or possible to make data available. If it is not possible, remember the importance of enhancing transparency by providing details about how the research was conducted. These details can include the theoretical method adopted, the research setting, the relationship between researcher and participants, anonymized patient characteristics.\nStrategies to make your research more reproducible are presented throughout the PaportTrail course: Research Integrity, Research Data Management, Open Reporting, Knowledge Dissemination.\nThere are resources available to help. Examples of resources in University College Cork include a digital badge in the responsible conduct of research that includes training on research reproducibility.\nThere are post-graduate modules on reproducible research Practices, PG6030, and an Introduction to Research Integrity, Ethics, and Open Science, PG6015.\nThe UCC Boole Library also run a variety of training sessions. Other universities may have supports including training and workshops to support you to develop reproducible research methods.\nThere are also online networks and communities you can follow and join. For example, the UK Reproducibility Network, UKRN. The UKRN provides guidance and resources for methods and strategies for improving research reproducibility.\nReproducibility for Everyone, this provides resources and webinars on strategies for reproducible research.\nReproducibiliTea, a community for early-stage researchers interested in open science and reproducibility.\nWhat efforts are universities and supervisors making to help us make research more reproducible?\nEfforts are increasing by supervisors and universities to support students.\nOne example of this, being led by Dr. Katherine Button, the University of Bath, is a collaborative approach to open research projects. In this model, students in a number of UK universities participate in a consortium to complete their final-year theses. The students receive extra support throughout the project to make their research reproducible.",

    "text": "Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo transcript - Research & Data Management\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Open Reporting?\nOpen reporting is the practice of providing a full, clear, and specific account of how research was conducted. This is done according to a standard template or set of guidelines.\nOpen reporting applies to all stages of the research process, from planning, to data collection, analysis, and write-up, to dissemination. It can be easy to focus only on reporting the findings of our research, but research involves choices and revisions at every stage of the process. Open reporting allows us to make our processes transparent, as well as our findings.\nIs open reporting applicable to all disciplines, though? Yes, but it is not currently in use in all disciplines. All disciplines are on their own open research journey, developing and adapting their own version.\nMost existing checklists and guidelines relate to medicine and health, and related disciplines.\nIt won’t be the same for everyone, and currently there are lots of gaps. But it is still important to know what it is and how to do it so you are prepared to report openly, and can better understand and evaluate how others report their research.\nWhy is Open Reporting Important?\nTraditionally, research reports place an emphasis on results, which has meant that other parts of the research process remain opaque. This limits other researchers’ abilities to evaluate or attempt to reproduce a study’s results. If flaws go undetected, invalid research results may still become part of the research record.\nThis may increase research waste as other researchers attempt to reproduce or build upon flawed evidence. It may also unduly impact both individual decisions and social policy.\nWhy is open reporting important?\n\nIt allows researchers to detail their processes and decisions at all stages of the research cycle.\nIt enhances other researchers’ ability to evaluate and/or verify a study’s results.\nIt enhances other researchers’ ability to reproduce a study’s results.\nIt facilitates researchers’ ability to bring together large bodies of evidence to better understand topics.\nIt benefits decision-making because decisions can be made on transparent research processes and findings.\n\nWhy is open reporting important for me?\nThat all sounds great for research more generally, but what about me as a student? It sounds like it takes extra time, and I’m not sure how I will benefit. By openly reporting what you have done in your research, you have a transparent account of your study.\nThis makes it easier for others, including your research supervisor, to see the steps you have taken. This can help to spot mistakes earlier on and correct them, and can help you get recognition for the work you put in at each step.\nThere are also lots of tools and resources to help you openly report. We will go through these in the next section.\nHow can we report research openly?\nIn this section, we focus on reporting guidelines and checklists.\nHow can we report research results openly? You can also openly report using pre-registration. This means making your research plans and processes publicly available before you start. Registered reports, these are research papers outlining proposed study methods and approach that are submitted to journals beforehand. You can find out more about pre-registration and registered reports in module two.\nWhat is a reporting guideline? It is the checklist, a structured text, or a flow diagram that guides researchers in how to report a specific type of research that has been developed using explicit methodology.\nWhat is the aim of a reporting guideline?\n\nTo help researchers create accessible and easily understood records of their research.\nTo help researchers create relevant records of their research.\nTo help researchers create records of their work containing sufficient detail to allow evaluation and/or reproduction.\n\nReporting guidelines and checklists\nWhen should I use an open reporting checklist? They are typically used when writing research reports and articles. Many journals now require you to submit a completed checklist with your submitted paper.\nYou can also use the checklists to guide your thinking and drafting of your protocol and/or ethics application.\nReporting guidelines and checklists. They are also useful to guide your process as well as essential to complete when writing up your final report. So how do I find a reporting guideline for my research, and how do I know which one is the right one to use?\nThere are resources you can use like the EQUATOR Network website. This has a list of guidelines you can use, and many are available in many different languages.\nExamples of reporting guidelines for different types of research\n\n\n\n Research type\n Guideline/Checklist\n\n\n Study protocols/ Clinical trial protocols\n SPIRIT; PRISMA-P\n\n\n Qualitative research\n COREO; SRQR\n\n\n Randonmised trials\n CONSORT\n\n\n Observational studies\n STROBE\n\n\n Systematic reviews\n PRISMA\n\n\n Diagnostic/prognostic studies\n STARD; TRIPOD\n\n\nCase reports\nCARE\n\n\nClinical practice guidelines\nAGREE; RIGHT\n\n\nAnimal pre-clinical research\nARRIVE\n\n\nQuality improvement studies\nSQUIRE\n\n\nEconomic evaluations\nCHEERS\n\n\nCase studies\nChecklist for case studies\n\n\nEcology studies\nTTEE\n\n\n\nDon’t worry if you can’t find the right one for you on the previous slide. We have included some of the most well-known guidelines but there are still many more beyond these, and more being developed in new areas and disciplines all the time.\nNext we will take a look at some guidelines and checklists in a bit more detail. Even if the checklists we go through are not directly relevant to your study, understanding how to complete a reporting checklist is important for all studies.\n\nPRISMA checklist, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\nA 27-item checklist representing an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including the title, abstract, methods, results, discussion and funding.\nA useful basis for reporting systematic reviews of a range of different research approaches, though largely focused on reporting of reviews evaluating randomized trials.\n\nSRQR, standards for reporting qualitative research.\n\nA 22-item checklist with broadly applicable standards for reporting qualitative research. Allows researchers to report important aspects of qualitative studies, including standards on the qualitative approach and paradigm, researcher characteristics and reflexivity, study methods, analysis, synthesis and interpretations.\n\nSTROBE, strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology.\n\nA 22-item checklist for reporting of observational studies, including the title, abstract, methods, results, discussion, and funding. Focuses mainly on reporting of cross-sectional cohort and case control studies, not only for epidemiological studies but for observational research in any discipline.",

Open science can be defined as the movement to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society. It can also be viewed as research simply done properly.\nIn this course, we use the term open research instead of open science. This reflects the inclusion of all disciplines in which research is conducted.\nSome aspects and practices of open research can differ depending on the area you are studying. This introductory course will help you identify what aspects are useful overall and for your specific context.\nThere are five schools of thought about open research.\n\nThe infrastructure school relates to making research platforms, tools, and services openly available.\nThe pragmatic school relates to enhancing efficiency of knowledge creation and research.\nThe public school relates to making research accessible to the public.\nThe democratic school relates to making knowledge available to everyone.\nAnd the measurement school relates to developing and using alternative approaches to measuring impact.",

It includes the processes researchers use to share research with other researchers and the general public.\nTo understand what open dissemination is, it is helpful to first think about how dissemination of research has typically been conducted. Traditional dissemination consisted of the steps outlined in the next slide.\nHow is research typically disseminated?\nStep 1. Designing and conducting research.\nStep 2. Analysing data and generating results.\nStep 3. Writing up the research findings in the form of a journal article and submitting this for publication in an academic journal.\nStep 4. The study undergoes peer review, and a decision is made about whether the article can be accepted, needs to be revised or is rejected.\nStep 5. Eventually the article will be published on the Journal website and or in print.\nWhat are some of the challenges of traditional knowledge dissemination?\n\nIt can take a long time for researchers to get their findings published and for anyone interested to be able to read them.\nArticles in traditional journals are often behind paywalls, which means they can only be accessed by paying a subscription or fee. This makes it harder for people to access the information, you’ve probably already encountered this as a student.\nIn addition, institutions may subscribe to journals, but not all institutions can afford the same fees. This can create and reinforce inequalities in access to knowledge.\n\nSo paywalls and barriers to accessing knowledge also impact on transparency of research. And if research is not disseminated transparently, it can’t be learnt from and or built upon.\nAnother problem is that the traditional processes may be biased towards publishing novel, exciting and or significant results. This is a phenomenon known as the file drawer problem. It means that only some findings are available which can bias our understanding and means we only have an incomplete picture.\nWhat are some of the challenges of traditional knowledge dissemination?\nIt is also a big problem because it can influence which questions researchers choose to ask. So research becomes focused on what researchers can get published rather than on what we should be examining. It can also incentivise researchers to engage in questionable research or reporting practises to produce novel, exciting and or significant results.\n\nWhat is open knowledge dissemination?\n\nIt involves sharing research more quickly and openly than in a traditional approach.\nIt includes approaches that can reduce inequalities by sharing information and broader, more accessible ways.\nIt is not only open access publishing, although this is an important component.\n\nMethods for openly disseminating research\n1. Open access publishing\n2. Preprint\n3. Online repositories\n4. Science communication\n5. Citizen science\nWe will take you through these and the following module sections.\nPotential obstacles to open research dissemination\nMaking research papers openly available involves fees that researchers must pay. This is not always possible.\nSome forms of open knowledge dissemination do not require research to be peer reviewed and checked. This may lead to dissemination of lower quality research, however, the challenges of monitoring quality of openly disseminated research may be balanced by increased transparency and post publication peer review. It is also increasingly clear that traditional approaches to dissemination do not also ensure quality either.\nWhy is open knowledge dissemination important?\nMethods for openly disseminating research\nOpen dissemination methods facilitate: 1. Transparency in research to better access 2. Knowledge for individuals and society 3. Equity in access to knowledge 4. Reshaping of how researchers are rewarded or incentivised to do research 5. Rewarding methodological rigour and integrity instead of just findings 6. Quicker availability of research findings compared to traditional routes 7. Making research more easily accessible with less or no cost.\nOpen dissemination methods can increase your visibility as a researcher, and the visibility of your research. They make it easier for you to access the research and information you need, and give you more control over what, when and how you share your research.\nOpen Access Publishing\nWhat is open access publishing?\nOpen access publishing means publishing research in a format so that it is made openly available for anyone to read without any cost to the reader. There are many dedicated open access journals where people can publish their research openly. There are also increasing numbers of journals offering an open access publishing option in addition to the standard publishing approach. Research funders are increasingly requiring funded researchers to publish their findings open access.\nWhat is open access publishing? Open access publishing has costs for the researcher, though, who usually has to pay fees to make their research openly available.\nThis is a barrier to open publishing. It also reflects a bigger problem of costs in publishing, either way, that public money funds research, but there are always costs involved for the public to be able to access.\nWhat is open access publishing? There are other approaches like preprint that can help get around these issues. We’ll discuss these soon.\nBenefits of open access\n- It is easier for everyone, including you, to access research if it is published as open access.\n- Open access publishing allows citizens to share in knowledge and evidence on issues that affects them.\n- Open access publications can increase exposure and impact of your research. Open access publications are reported to receive more media coverage.\n- A lot of research is funded by public money awarded through grants, so open access makes sure the public can see what they have funded.\nHow do I make my research open access?\nIf you go on to publish your research project, you can consider publishing it in an open access publication. The directory of open access journals provides a list of such journals across multiple disciplines.\nRemember, though, that open access publications have costs for you as the researcher submitting the paper. You can often apply for open access fee waivers, especially for student work that is not supported by funding. Waivers are not always granted, though, so open access publishing may not always be possible due to cost.\nPreprints\nWhat are preprints?\nPreprints are copies of research manuscripts that have been uploaded to designated preprint servers before undergoing journal peer review. They are the same manuscript that will be submitted to a journal, so they represent the final work.\nAre men who smoke at higher risk for more severe case of covid-19 than women who smoke? A systematic review.\nThis is an example of a preprint published by students and their supervisor from UCC.\nBenefits and drawbacks to preprint\nUploading a pre-print of your manuscript allows for free and rapid dissemination of your research. When reading reprints, it is important to remember that they have not been peer reviewed and so should be read with a degree of caution.\nWhile many journals now have policies allowing and encouraging preconceive research articles, some do not accept preprint. There are ways to check which journals do and don’t accept preference. We talk more about this shortly.\nHow do I do a preprint?\nIf you are planning to publish your research project, you can upload a copy of the final manuscript to a pre-print server. You must do this before you submit it to a journal for peer review.\nOK, but how do I actually prepare my manuscript and find where to upload it? An important first step is talking to your supervisor about making your research available as a pre-print.\nYou should then identify a suitable preprint server. Some examples are archived bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv. You can see examples of preference on any of the above servers to help guide you in preparing to upload your preprint.\nAs your preprint is the same manuscript that you will submit to the journal. Any changes to your manuscript will mostly be formatting and uploading requirements.\nIt is very important to check that the journal you want to publish your manuscript in accepts prints, share Borromeo provides up to date information about individual journals, open access policies. So check here first.\nOnce you are sure your target journal accept preprints, you have identified a relevant preprint server and have prepared your paper, you can upload it to the pre-print server.\nRepositories\nWhat are repositories?\nA repository is a database for storing data sets or research outputs, e.g. manuscript’s. Many universities have their own repositories for affiliated researchers to use e.g., Coursera and UCC.\nPutting research outputs on repositories can make them more visible. Researchers have control over what is made publicly available when putting data or outputs on repositories.\n\nRepositories can be domain or discipline specific or maybe more general.\nExamples of domain specific repositories, Leanness, Health Research, Emelle, a core humanities Izidor, social sciences and humanities.\nExamples of more general repositories, open science framework and Xanadu.\n\nTo upload your research paper, manuscript or data, you must first identify an appropriate repository. Once you have identified a repository, follow the repository guidance to upload your paper or data.\nAn important note on uploading data to a repository\nIf you were uploading data to an online repository, make sure you are adhering to ethical considerations and data sharing guidelines.\nYou should complete the PaporTrail module on Research and Data Management to find out more about this. You should also consult your institutional research and data sharing guidelines and support services.\nThe OSFI allows researchers to: 1) Store and make available their research outputs 2) manage their workflows and keep projects organised 3) store data analyses and reports 4) assign a digital object identifier to their project 5) link projects to researcher.\nScience Communication\nWhat is science communication?\n\nSharing research ideas, methods and knowledge with non expert audiences.\nSharing these in ways which are useful, understandable, accessible and or tailored.\nThe goal is to inform the public.\nThis is usually done in engaging ways to also increase interest in research and its outputs and to influence people’s opinions and behaviours.\n\nCommunicating the findings of your research is as important as conducting the research.\nScience communication is not limited to traditional academic approaches, but can incorporate a range of different approaches.\nScience communication is not just for science. It can incorporate a range of different approaches aimed at the target audience, including the wider community or special interest groups, e.g. policymaker’s blogs, public talks and images. Approaches can include things like public talks, e.g., point of science, social media, including using GIFs, check, hashtag, a bit of cake for good examples of student research.\nBlog posts like this one about personalised medicine, videos using visuals or infographics, podcasts like the Orion Open Science Podcast and newspapers and the media.\n\nIt enhances the sharing of research findings.\nIt increases public understanding of research.\nIt increases public interest in research and for it can help research to make an impact by reaching target audiences.\n\nHow do I do science communication if you aren’t ready to share your research with the public?\nYes, a good starting place with science communication is to see how other people are doing is.\n\nThere are likely blogs relevant to your discipline or research interests that you could look at.\nGraphical abstracts, which visually represent the research, are becoming increasingly common in journal publications.\nThere are thousands of TED and TED talks, which you can watch Twitter threads, YouTube and other social media include examples of science communication to.\nThere are also local, national and international activities you can attend. Your university may have events and competitions like a three minute thesis where researchers present their research in three minutes.\nOther activities include things like point of science, where researchers present their research in a pub setting Fame Lab, which is an international science communication competition for researchers, including research students.\n\nWhen you’re ready to share your research, you might want to take part in some of these activities.\nWhen you are ready to share your research with the public, it is important to first identify who your target audience is. Is it everyone or is it a specific group that your research is most relevant to?\nThink about what message or messages you want to share, what are the key findings, the things that are most important for your audience to know?\nThink about ways that you can share this information.\nThere are lots of options like in-person talks or using videos, visual representations, podcasts or blog posts.\nIt is important that you avoid using technical terms or jargon when sharing your research with the public, you want it to be accessible to everyone.\nTry to include visuals as well as speaking text, this can maintain attention and keep it interesting for the audience.\nHow do I do science communication?\nMake it relatable. Remember, you are not communicating as a researcher to other researchers, so only include examples and anecdotes that are relatable to your target audience.\nRemember that because science communication aims for exclusivity, it can be difficult for the audience to decide what is reliable information.\nIf you were doing science communication, be sure to support your points with accessible data and or supporting information.\nIf you are viewing science communication, put your researcher hat on to determine if the communicator is supporting their points.\nCitizen Science\nWhat is citizen science?\n\nIt is an open and inclusive approach to conducting research.\nIt involves input from the public in the research process as observers identifying images or providing or analysing data.\nIt is an aim of open research because open research works towards exclusivity, 4. It is also an enabler of open research because including the public and research increases its openness.\nIt is not simply having members of the public involved as participants. They are instead active research partners.\n\nBenefits of citizen science\nIt promotes research that is conducted for the people and by the people. It enhances public engagement in and with research. It nurtures public investment in an understanding of scientific processes and outputs.\nCase study: The people’s trial\nCheck out the people’s trial for an excellent example of citizen science and science, communication and action. The public were involved in all stages of the project from deciding what research question to examine, to deciding how the findings should be shared.\nFor example, the public were asked to come up with possible research questions, they came up with one hundred and fifty five questions.\nThe public then voted on which one they should examine, the question they decided on was: Does reading a book in bed make a difference to sleep in comparison to not reading a book in bed?\nThis video was used to explain the what, why and how of deciding a research question.\nFind out more about the people’s trial by visiting their website.\nCitizen science is a bit trickier to include in a student project. You can get involved in ongoing citizen science projects that you come across. For instance, projects like the All Ireland Ladybird survey that involves the public in tracking Ireland’s native Ledebur population using a smartphone app.",

Researchers wanted a fast, easy, and low-cost way of sharing data with each other. So the internet was born. Now the internet dominates almost all aspects of our daily lives. Yet it has deviated from its original purpose.\nOpen research is the movement to bring modern research back in line with its original digital intent.\nThe open access movement This movement began in the early 1990s with the aim to make research products available to everyone including the general public.\nImproving transparency and reproducibility. This relates to making research processes and outputs more open so other researchers could examine and reproduce them.\nThe open science movement. This was aimed at correcting bad science and restoring public trust in scientific research.\nOpen research. It became evident that more open research practices could apply across disciplines, not just in science. This would ensure reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration across disciplines.\nOpen research methods are still evolving within the sciences, and some disciplines are just beginning to develop open research methods that suit their subjects.\nMethodological issues and questionable research practices. Part of the move towards open research was driven by problems that were becoming apparent in the scientific literature.\nOpen research partly emerged in response to methodological crisis whereby it was not possible to replicate or reproduce many scientific studies and findings. This reproducibility crisis or replicability crisis has been most commonly reported in psychology and some areas of health and medicine.\nFor example, in one survey of over 1,500 researchers, more than 70% had tried and failed to reproduce another researcher’s findings, and more than half had failed to reproduce their own findings.\nOpen research also aims to address questionable research practices. What are questionable research practices?\nOne, they are practices and techniques that do not follow best research practice. Two, they can be used to get a desired research result or report research findings in a more favorable manner. Three, they undermine trust and confidence in research findings. Four, they introduce bias to research processes and findings. Questionable research practices can take place at any stage of the research process.\nSelective reporting involves cherry-picking and publishing only findings that are novel, exciting, or statistically significant.\nUnderspecified methods involves not sharing methods with other researchers in enough detail so that they can attempt to replicate it. Data dredging, exploiting the data to achieve novel, exciting or statistically significant results, HARKing, hypothesizing after results are known, reporting unexpected findings as though they were expected from the start.\nWhy do researchers engage in Q or Ps?\nBad science is not always conducted by bad researchers. So why does it happen? The perception that more research outputs is better creates pressure to publish. This can negatively impact how people do research. They may cut corners to get more research published. Profit motives or ideological commitments might make researchers engage in poor practices.\nPoor research practices might also just reflect how researchers were taught in the first place.\nResearchers can also just make mistakes. As a student, it can be easy to engage in QRPs. If I think exciting or significant results will lead to a better grade, I might engage in questionable research practices. Time constraints and coursework pressures can also lead to cutting corners.\nIt is important to guard against questionable research practices in all your research activities. This ensures the research you conduct is robust and trustworthy.\nIncreased and ongoing awareness of issues around reproducibility and QRPs has led to improved open research practices. Open research practices can improve the validity and integrity of research. Though poor methods exist, open research aims to improve them. It is these practices and the underlying principles of open research that we will introduce you to in this course.\nDid you know making and having open research is so important that it is in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights? According to this document, everyone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts, and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits. Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary, or artistic production where they are the author.\nTake a look at the video that’s linked here and on Canvas on how open research can help fix broken research culture. The video discusses science but is relevant across disciplines.",

Ensuring quality of research in all stages of the research process.\nHonesty. developing, conducting, sharing, and engaging with research in fair and transparent ways.\nRespect. for research participants, colleagues, society, culture and the environment.\nAccountability for the research, its management and its wider impacts.\n\nWhat is research integrity?\nResearch integrity involves making honest, responsible decisions at all stages of the research cycle. Planning, data collection, data analysis, writing up, reporting, dissemination.\nWhy is research integrity important?\n\nIt reduces the likelihood of research misconduct.\nIt ensures validity of research results.\nIt facilitates trust between researchers.\nIt promotes trust in data and research expertise.\n\nWhy is research integrity important for you?\nThe research practices that you learn will influence how you conduct and use research now and in the future.\nAs a research student, you should focus on building your skills. Skills like academic honesty, including learning to site sources completely and accurately, so that you can give credit where credit is due.\nOr data interpretation. By learning best practices for data analysis and reporting in your discipline, you can be sure to report your findings accurately.\nResearch integrity can also help you minimize research waste. By making responsible decisions about whether research should be done and how it should be done, you can minimize waste of time and resources.\n\nWasteful behaviors include conducting unnecessary research on topics that have already been addressed.\nNot properly designing your study or being careless in your research activities are wasteful behaviors.\nConducting research without being transparent about what you did can also be wasteful.\n\nWhat practices can compromise research integrity?\nPlagiarism, including self-plagiarism, giving or taking credit for work inappropriately.\nFabricating data, misrepresenting data, manipulation of images or other materials, undeclared conflicts of interest.\nWhat is plagiarism?\nPlagiarism is a practice of misrepresenting someone else’s words or ideas as your own. It is also possible to self-plagiarize.\nThis happens when an author passes off old work as new. For example, by submitting one paper for credit in two separate modules.\nAvoiding plagiarism. How do you avoid plagiarism?\n\nAlways acknowledge the work and contributions of other people.\nWhen paraphrasing or summarizing someone else’s work, include a citation.\nIf including text from someone else’s work verbatim, use quotation marks and include a citation.\nCite primary sources of information rather than secondary or tertiary sources.\n\nYour university will have resources to help you avoid plagiarism, too. In UCC, for example, a citing, referencing, and plagiarism course is available here.\nAnd check out this video on how to site sources. And this one on examples of plagiarism. They are short but very useful. Giving or taking credit for work inappropriately.\nIf someone makes a meaningful contribution to a research project, they should receive credit for their contribution.\nThis might mean they are an author on a final paper or receive an acknowledgement on that paper.\nThere is guidance to determine if someone makes a meaningful contribution like the IC JME criteria.\nYou might also ask yourself, did they contribute to the study idea design?\nDid they conduct analyses or contribute to interpreting findings?\nDid they assist with writing up the final report paper?\nIf someone doesn’t make a meaningful contribution, they shouldn’t be given credit.\nFor instance, listing uninvolved members of a research group or more senior\nacademics who only looked at the final paper.\nThese kind of authors are sometimes called ghost authors.\nData fabrication. Data fabrication is a process of manufacturing or making up data. For example, an anthropologist might write transcripts of interviews they never conducted. These transcripts, false data, might become part of the research record.\nThis can result in unreliable data and waste research resources through attempted replications.\nCovid 19 example. A paper published in 2020 reported increased risk of debt for people hospitalized with Covid 19 if they had underlying cardiovascular disease. Findings were based on data supposedly collected by the company of one of the study authors. It quickly became apparent that the data was fraudulent. The paper was retracted, but such questionable practices can undermine trust in research.\nData misrepresentation.\nData misrepresentation is a practice of presenting real data in a misleading way. Researchers might emphasize exciting or novel findings only. Researchers might also distort or duplicate images of their findings.\nSome researchers even magnified or reverse their images to try and avoid detection. Data misrepresentation gives an incomplete picture of the research findings. Like other questionable research practices, it can result in unreliable data. It can also waste research resources through attempted replications.\nPiracy and manipulation of images, other materials. Sometimes researchers manipulate figures, images, or other resources to include them in multiple research papers. Often these manipulated materials come from organizations known as paper mills.\nPaper mills turn out fake data, images, and whole papers to meet demand from researchers. But there are also researchers working to identify this manipulated content so it can be retracted.\nUndeclared conflicts of interest.\nA conflict of interest is when a researcher’s other interests lead to intentional or unintentional biases in research.\nConflicts of interest may in turn compromise the validity of the results.\nFor example, a researcher receiving funding for pharmaceutical development may be incentivized to demonstrate that competitors drugs are unsafe or inferior. This may shape how they conduct their research and impact the findings which will influence people’s health and care in the future.\nWhy do people engage in research misconduct?\nThere are several factors that can motivate research misconduct. Some are emotional like fear of failure. Misconduct may also be motivated by external pressures like pressure from supervisors to achieve a certain result.\nResearchers may also feel pressure to perform due to the competitiveness of\nacademic culture. Worries about personal circumstances like employment status might also motivate misconduct.\nHow can you maintain high levels of research integrity?\nHow can I help reduce the effects of research misconduct?\n\nFollow best practices in research integrity and open research at all stages of the research process.\nAvoid plagiarism.\nAccurately and honestly represent your data.\nGive credit where it is due.\nBe transparent and responsible in all aspects of and decisions about your research.\n\nHow can I help reduce the effects of research misconduct?\nYou can also comment on and review already published papers using platforms like Pubpeer. This helps flag issues in research that are already in the public domain.\nPubier is an online journal club that exists as an app on the Chrome browser. It allows researchers to comment on published journal articles. This is called postpublication peer review.\nResearchers can highlight problems in analysis, interpretation, and/or reporting of results. Pubier has contributed to many corrections and retractions of published articles.\nMost universities have a research code of conduct that outlines what to do if you suspect research misconduct in your university. Research misconduct can usually be reported in writing to an established research integrity officer in your institution. This is someone trained to follow up and investigate suspected misconduct.\nIf you suspect research misconduct outside of your university, you can contact the editors or administrators of the journal website where the work appears.\nWhat happens then? Processes are in place in your university to manage the outcomes of research integrity issues. Your research support office can guide you on this.\nWhen research integrity issues or misconduct are identified in published research, these studies are retracted.\nThe paper is withdrawn from the journal in which it is published. It may still be available online, but it include a notification that it has been retracted.\nRetraction Watch, which was launched in 2010, is a blog that tracks retracted papers. The Retraction Watch database contains entries for each retracted paper. By the end of 2020, there were nearly 25,000 retracted papers in the database. Retraction Watch also keeps track of individual researchers with multiple retractions in its leaderboard.\nYou can check out Retraction Watch here.\nHow can you demonstrate research integrity? - Educate yourself about research integrity. - Follow institutional codes of conduct for research. University College Cork’s research code of conduct is available here.",

This expands on the traditional approach to sharing research knowledge, which involves publishing it in an academic journal that can often only be accessed by paying a fee.\n\nApproaches to open knowledge dissemination include open access publishing. Anyone can access the published research without paying a fee. Preprints, versions of research papers made available online before being peer-reviewed and published. Repositories, databases people can use to store and access research papers and/or data sets.\nScience communication. sharing research in a way that increases appreciation, excitement, understanding and impact of research and data visualization representing data graphically or visually to increase its accessibility.\nWhy is open knowledge dissemination important?\n\n\nIt increases public access to and interest in research.\nIt increases the transparency and openness of research.\nIt helps reshape what is considered important in research and academia.\n\nFor the activity for this section, complete the activity below to reflect on where in the research cycle different open research practices are relevant.",
