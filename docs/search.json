    "text": "1.1 Examples of open research projects\nWhat is open research? There are many different definitions, and these may vary from discipline to discipline and across research methodologies. Here are a couple of examples:\nSimply, open research is a way of doing research that focuses on being transparent, honest, and thorough. It’s about making sure that all the steps of a study are clear and accessible, so that other researchers can understand, verify, and build upon the methodology and findings. It is an open door to research evidence, where everyone can see what’s available and contribute to the collective pool of knowledge.\nNo matter what your career stage, it is important to learn about how open research applies to your discipline, so that you can better assess the quality of research in your field and conduct more open research yourself. By the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of the principles underlying open research, and a set of practical techniques you can use to translate these abstract principles into action.\nTo give you an idea of what open research can look like, here are some examples. It is a good idea to open these in a new tab or window (right mouse click or long press), so you can easily return to this page:\nExample 1: The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) is an impressive project in astronomy. IVOA is a framework that allows astronomical data to be shared and accessed globally. Over the years, the IVOA has developed standards and protocols to facilitate the seamless integration of data from various observatories, making it available to the global community. Have a play around with ESA Sky (built on IVOA protocols) yourself!\nExample 2: The mRNA Vaccine Technology Transfer Hub is an innovative project in the field of biotechnology and global health. Established by the WHO (World Health Organization) to facilitate the widespread production of mRNA vaccines, this hub provides training, resources, and support to manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries. This openness enables a broader range of producers to develop mRNA vaccines, helping to combat pandemics and improve global health security.\nExample 3: The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) funds rigorous, high-quality evaluations of educational interventions. They are conducted by independent evaluators rather than the team that initially developed the intervention. All studies are registered ahead of time and the evaluation protocol is published in advance. All study findings are published on the EEF website, regardless of the outcome of the study.\nExample 4: The Pelagios Network is an inspiring example from the humanities. It is a community of researchers, data scientists and curators who use linked data methods and tools to investigate the past. Their interests are wide-ranging (history, language, archaeology, conservation, etc.) and span the field of cultural heritage, including universities, galleries, libraries, archives and museums. There’s more on this project in the next section.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Spotlight: the Pelagios Network\nThe Pelagios Network uses linked open data to share information and support collaboration between scholars. The basic idea of linked open data goes back to the pioneers of the World Wide Web. It is a powerful way to freely use and distribute information.\nThroughout this course, we use videos to present perspectives on open research. Take a little time to write notes on these videos.\nOur first video, funded by AHRC and created by Too Tall Productions, takes you on a whistle-stop tour of how the Pelagios Network uses linked open data. As you watch, think about why this has the potential to be a great tool for research.\n\n\nVideo 1: Linked open data, what on earth is that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Transcript - Click to expand\n\n\n\n\n\nPresenter: The archaeologist Winifred Lamb was a pioneer, not only in her research, but as a female in an occupation dominated by men.\nWinifred Lamb: Yes, but the research is so slow!\nPresenter: Excuse me?\nWinifred Lamb: Have you ever heard of linked open data?\nPresenter: No.\nWinifred Lamb: Right. When I’m fortunate enough to find an object such as this, I want to know more about it and how it links to other objects. But with the current research methods, researching objects and sites can take ages. I have to take a car, a plane, a bus to the library to find a book to look up which museum has the object I want to compare my object with, only to discover it’s on loan to a museum in Los Angeles. But these days we have a thing called the World Wide Web.\nPeople like me put their knowledge and research up there for all to see, so it can be viewed by anyone anywhere in the world, and it all links together. It’s called ‘linked open data’. And it can help us do research at lightning speed. When you put data out there on the web for all to see, and if we collaborate to help link this data, then that’s when we get linked open data. It means objects like this can talk to other objects all around the world. Locations, people, artifacts, books, we can link anything.\nMembers of the Pelagios community and friends of the Linking Islands of Data network have used the new technology to enrich the writings of the traveller Pausanias. His first-hand accounts of ancient Greece now link to enhanced information. This can lead to museum records, numismatic collections, and catalogues of Greek pottery.\nIn this way, linked open data can help us make meaningful connections and tell new stories which traditional methods of research could never achieve. And what’s more it can be accessed from anywhere in the world. So, through collaboration, we can all help make linked open data truly powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo 2: Using linked open data\nNow listen to Professor Elton Barker, classicist and co-founder of the Pelagios Network, to get the backstory. He talks about the very first attempts at collaboration, and how linked open data has helped him with his own research. As you watch the video, think about how this kind of resource could also help with other types of research.\n Click to download video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Transcript - Click to expand\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my name is Elton Barker. I’m a professor of Greek literature and culture at The Open University. That basically means I read a lot of ancient Greek literature and put that into its cultural and political context. But I’m also interested in the stories that we can extract from ancient Greek narratives in terms of their spatiality. So we don’t have maps of the ancient world, but we do have a lot of spatial knowledge embedded in texts.\nSo Pelagios, in its initial form, this goes back to 2012, I think. The proof of concept was working with the Persius classical library in the States, lots of people know that, it’s a fantastic resource - the German archaeological database, Arachne, and also the Pleiades Gazetteer. These were our three external partners and through these three external partners, we were able to come up with this lightweight method of connecting data, basically connecting their information.\nSo what can linked open data do for you? Well, let me give an example from a project that I’m working on. The title is the Digital Periegesis, which basically means a digital ‘going around’. It’s an echoing of a title of an ancient Greek narrative written in the second century CE, by this Greek called Pausanias. And he gives this deep dive into the Greek mainland. He doesn’t just talk about Athens, he takes you into Athens and he talks about the sites in Athens down to the ground level.\nSo not just there’s the Acropolis, but he takes you into inside the temple, he talks about the statues, the paintings, it’s a level of granularity you don’t get anywhere else. And one quick win there, of course, is that we can then visualise the places that he visited , and draw a line, and kind of follow Pausanias’ footsteps.\nBut critically, - this is where the linked open data comes in - there are two things I think are really interesting. The first is, as you are following Pausanias around, you can also link out to other materials. Because Pausanias, I’ve mentioned, he talks about statues, he talks about paintings.\nNow, we have this information in other resources, the German archaeological database again comes back. They have great resources in Athens and elsewhere. So as you are moving through Pausanias’ text and he’s describing these objects on the ground, you can link out from the text and go and have a look. The second critical thing, and this is where I think linked data gets really exciting, is that you can discover stuff that he doesn’t talk about. Let me give you one example.\nIn book one, he’s in Athens, he’s moving around Athens. He’s moving around the central marketplace of Athens and moving to talk about the great Olympian Temple of Zeus. You can see it from the map. But then using linked data means we can bring in other information about that area. So what other artefacts are in that area? And one artefact that is shown is the Arch of Hadrian.\nNow that appears on our map because that information has been published as linked data, by the Pleiades Gazetteer. But it’s not in Pausanias. So that already starts to ask us really interesting questions. Why does he not talk about the Arch of Hadrian? It’s not as if he couldn’t have seen it. It’s still there in Athens. You can go and look at the Arch of Hadrian now. He would probably have had to walk through the Arch of Hadrian to get to the Temple of Zeus. So why not mention it? I think this idea of using linked data to draw attention to the gaps, the absences, the biases in text, I think is one of the most exciting things about it.\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nUsing your own notebook (online or offline), take some notes on what you have learned from both videos. How does the Pelagios Network use linked open data? What are the particular features of linked open data that Prof. Barker believes are most useful for scholars?\n When you are ready, press the button to view our comments.\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  How the Pelagios Network use linked open data\nThe Pelagios Network researchers are interested in Greek objects and texts. Even if you come from a very different discipline, you should still be able to recognise how linked open data allows researchers in different institutions to collaborate, enriching the amount of data they can all access. The data is organised in a systematic way and given permanent identifiers, so the information can be scrutinised from different perspectives, and reused by researchers in other institutions or disciplines.\n  \n\nSo far, you have been introduced to five examples of open research projects from astronomy, medicine, education and the humanities. What do these disparate projects, from very different academic disciplines, have in common? To a greater or lesser extent, they all share some foundational principles. In this course, open research will be broken down into three key facets that span across disciplines: transparency, integrity, and accessibility. Let’s start with transparency.",

    "text": "1.2 Transparency\nThe principle of transparency in research refers to the practice of being open and honest about all aspects of the research process.\nIn the TV show, Great British Bake Off, contestants compete in a UK-wide baking competition. In some tasks bakers are assessed on their creativity and flavour combinations, but in the show’s ‘Technical challenge’ they all have to follow the same recipe and make the same thing. Simple, right? Well, if it’s so simple, then why are there so many soggy bottoms?\nTechnical challenge instructions:\n\nMake the cake batter\nBake the cake\nIce the cake\n\nEven when a recipe is provided, there can be a lot missing. In the technical challenge above, the instructions do not specify which ingredients should go into the cake batter, in what order they should be added, or how long the cake should be baked. A recipe for disaster!\nA similar issue occurs in many academic research papers. Researchers describe what they did, but often not in enough detail for someone else to clearly understand what was done, or to repeat the study themselves. This means that another researcher hoping to reproduce the study may not able to reproduce it accurately. This is referred to as a study’s replicability.\nSimilarly, why are there so many amazing looking cakes on Pinterest, which become ‘Pinterest fails’ when people try to make them at home?\n\n\n\nCat cakes: reality versus expectations.\n\n\nSometimes it might be because the person sharing the beautiful picture of their cake tried thirty times before one turned out right, but fails to mention this, and instead tells readers how easy it was to make!\nSimilarly, researchers can fail to disclose versions of studies that they have tried, but that in their view didn’t ‘work’, choosing instead to share results from those studies that had the results that they desired.\n\nActivity 2\n What are all the things you could include in a recipe to give the baker the best chance of success? Make a note in your notebook. Try to think of at least five before revealing the answers below.\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Recipe for success?\nThe details will differ from person to person. In your answer, you might have included things like: pictures of each step, temperature of the oven, ingredients, length of baking time, size of tin, order of adding ingredients, how long to mix, and possible substitutions. It is likely that the details you included are those that will help determine whether your cake looks like the cat cake on the left, or the cat cake on the right. In the same way, researchers are more likely to be able to get the same result as other researchers if they can follow clear instructions on how to conduct the study.",

    "text": "1.3 Integrity\nThe principle of integrity refers to the degree of trustworthiness or believability of research findings. So, a transparent study is trustworthy and believable, right? Not necessarily! Transparency can be considered to be necessary, but not sufficient, for assessing integrity. Being transparent about how a study was done enables other researchers to better assess whether the study has integrity.\nIf you let your friend taste a cake you’ve made, but don’t tell them any of the ingredients that went into it, they might have a harder job working out why they do or don’t like it than if they know what went into it. For example, if they liked that the cake tasted citrussy, they would not know that was because of the grapefruit zest in the ingredients list (rather than maybe lemon juice or citric acid).\n\nActivity 3\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nNow let’s assume you have been completely transparent about your ingredients. Can you think of any circumstances where there could still be doubts about your integrity? Write down some notes for yourself. \n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Considering integrity\nThere are lots of different ideas about what gives research findings integrity, and this will vary greatly depending on the field and research methodology. One important distinction is between qualitative and quantitative methodologies. In the next section, you’ll find out how this can fundamentally affect how researchers think about integrity.",

They decide to make three batches of cookies: one where each cookie has five chocolate chips, one where each has ten chocolate chips and one where each has fifteen chocolate chips. They ask participants to eat one of each cookie type and rank each cookie type from 1 (worst cookie) to 3 (best cookie). In other words, the researcher uses numerical (quantitative) data to work out how to make the most delicious cookie.\nWhen conducting quantitative research, researchers often try to remove themselves as much as possible from the research, aiming for objectivity (although there is considerable debate about whether this is possible!). As such, quantitative researchers believe that the replicability of a study is of the utmost importance for that study to be considered to have integrity. This means that when another researcher conducts the same study, they should get the same results.",

They might ask participants to describe the best and worst chocolate chip cookies they’ve ever eaten, and what they liked or disliked about them.\nIn qualitative research, objectivity is seldom desired or even considered possible. Instead, subjectivity is embraced explicitly, and researchers may include their own perspectives when writing up their papers. They wouldn’t necessarily assume that if someone else conducted the same study they would get the same results due to the complex interplay between the context of the participants and unique positionality of the researchers.\nSo qualitative and quantitative researchers often have different opinions about whether a study needs to be replicable in order to have integrity.\nIt’s important not to assume that there’s only one way for research to have integrity, and to understand the importance of different ways of doing research. The cheesecake below might look burnt to someone who is used to non-baked cheesecakes, but will look perfect to someone who is used to baked cheesecakes!\n\n\n\nDelicious or burnt?\n\n\n\nActivity 4\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nIn this activity, you will have the chance to test your understanding of ‘transparency’ and ‘integrity’ in open research.

She publishes her methodology, including how participants were selected, how the drug was administered, and how data were collected and analysed. She also shares her raw data and statistical analysis code publicly, allowing others to verify her results or conduct their own analysis. She clarifies in her methodology that she isn’t planning on comparing the new drug to anything else.\n\n Make a note of your thoughts before revealing our comments.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Does the research have both transparency and integrity?\nDr. McGonagle has been transparent by publishing all the details of her study.

To increase the integrity of her research, she could compare the new drug to an existing drug and/or a placebo.",

    "text": "1.6 Accessibility\nThe principle of accessibility refers to ensuring that all who are interested are able to consume, evaluate, and otherwise interact with research products (e.g. data, results) and processes (e.g. methods). Even when research is transparent and has integrity, if only a limited group can access the outcomes or outputs of this research, it is not truly open.\nAsking people to pay to read a hidden recipe for the best cake ever means that only certain people will be able to afford to make it. This may not seem like the end of the world for cake, because cake is a luxury. We might even hope that the reason the recipe is behind a paywall is so that the author of the recipe can be paid for the hard work they put into developing it, as well as covering the costs to the website of editing and hosting the content. However, research is a bit different.\nOne reason for this is that the outputs of research are not a luxury, as research is used predominantly to solve the world’s problems! Another reason is that much research is publicly funded, meaning the public has a right to access the products of this research. Also, when research is behind a paywall (e.g. published in a journal where you have to pay to access articles), authors don’t get any of the money that people pay to read the article.\nIf authors want to make their article openly available to everyone, they usually have to pay for this themselves. That’s like a recipe creator either having to pay to have their recipe openly listed on a website, or the website charging for people to read the recipe which the recipe creator gave them for free.\nAccessibility is about more than just making the products of research available for free. Even if all research articles were free to read, if the public isn’t able to understand them, then they are useless! Converting a complicated recipe into bullet points, adding hints and tips, and translating it into different languages or adapting it for different accessibility needs, will mean that many more people are able to make the same recipe than if only the original version is provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause for thought\n\n\n\nTo publish an article openly in the famous journal Nature, researchers have to pay almost £9,000 (in 2024, at the time of writing; or US$12,000). Reflect on how APCs affect researchers in the Global South, and how journals might address this. Then, look up whether Nature has any ways of addressing this (clue: search for ‘APC waiver’).",

    "text": "2.1 Sharing data and materials\nIn Week 1, you learned about what transparency is, and why being transparent is important in research. Ensuring your study generates open data and materials is a good way to increase the transparency of your research.\nMaking the outputs of your study more open means the data and materials you have gathered during your research can be used, reused, and redistributed by anyone. Data refers to the information or facts collected, observed, or generated during the course of a study or investigation. For example, in the quantitative chocolate chip cookie example from Week 1, the chocolate chip ranking would be the data.\nMaterials refers to any materials used in a research study. These can include (but are not limited to) the code used to run any statistical analyses, protocols outlining exactly what was done in the study, auditory and visual stimulus files shown to participants, questionnaires, documents used to obtain consent from participants, and videos of the study being run.",

    "text": "2.2 Open data\nData can be shared even when it is not related to a paper. However, researchers tend to share data alongside their papers, so that readers can see the structure of their data more clearly, re-run analyses from the manuscript, run additional analyses, and use the data to answer new questions.\n\nWhat do we mean by data?\nData can look very different depending on the research field, for example:\n\n\n\nBiology\nGenomic data from projects like the Human Genome Project, providing sequences of human DNA and other organisms.\n\n\nSocial Sciences\nSurvey data on demographics, attitudes, and behaviours collected by organisations like the United Nations or national statistical agencies.\n\n\nMedicine\nClinical trial data, including study protocols, patient demographics, treatment interventions, and health outcomes.\n\n\nHistory\nArchives of historical documents, such as diaries, letters, manuscripts, and government records, providing insights into past events, societies, and cultures.\n\n\nLiterature\nText datasets containing literary works, poetry, plays, and other written texts, facilitating analysis of language use, stylistic trends, and cultural themes.\n\n\nMusicology\nMusical score datasets, containing compositions from different composers, genres, and historical periods, for analysis of musical structure and style.\n\n\n\nEven within one study, there will often be multiple levels of data. For example, a study using interviews will result in video recordings of the interviews, the source data, transcripts, processed data, and then the text from the transcript may be coded quantitatively or qualitatively, resulting in the coding data.\n\nCan all data be shared?\nTechnically, it is possible for all of these to be shared, if participants have consented to do so. However, it is usually important to protect the anonymity of participants. While this is often possible to do with transcript data (after anonymising any identifying information about participants), this would be very difficult if sharing their video recordings.\n\n\nWhat data can or cannot be shared?\nWhen we talk about open data, the phrase ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ is often used – meaning that researchers should strive to make their data open, but not where this would be unethical or illegal. Researchers must work within the ethical codes of their country and type of data collection. For example, in Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets out guidelines for dealing with ‘personal data’, i.e., any information related to an identifiable individual. To ensure human participants are not identifiable in our datasets, we as researchers must ensure we have removed all identifiable data from our datasets.\nIn some cases, this is obvious, simple, and doesn’t affect the usefulness of the data shared, for example removing IP addresses from data collected online. However, there are other cases where this is much more complex, and may result in the data not being possible to share at all, for example where data on a very specific topic makes participants identifiable.",

    "section": "2.3 The FAIR principles",
    "text": "2.3 The FAIR principles\nIn the previous section, you considered different types of data, and how open you can be when sharing them. Given the subtleties, it is useful to have a clear set of guidelines. The FAIR principles provide this. They state that shared data should be FAIR – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable:\n\nFindable: Data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. This involves using unique identifiers and metadata.\nAccessible: Once found, data should be easy to access, either openly or through an authentication or authorisation process. This ensures data is available in a standardised format.\nInteroperable: Data should be able to work with other data. This means using standardised formats and languages so that different systems can use the data together.\nReusable: Data should be well-documented and organised so that it can be used again in future research, potentially by different people. This includes clear information about how the data were collected and any licenses or permissions needed for its use.\n\n\n2.3.1 Expert voice: How do the FAIR principles work?\nIn this video, Isabel Chadwick, a research data specialist from the Open University, talks about the FAIR principles, and how they can help researchers look after their data. As you watch the video, think about how you could follow Isabel’s advice in your own research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name’s Isabel Chadwick. I’ve got a special interest in research data management. So my job involves helping researchers and research students to look after their data during their projects, thinking about all of the legal, ethical implications of looking after what is sometimes personal data, sometimes sensitive data, and sometimes just really, really big data.\nThe FAIR data principles are intended to give guidelines on the findability, the accessibility, the interoperability and the reusability of digital assets that are created during the course of research.\nThey go beyond merely saying that research data should be made open, and rather give more concrete guidance on how that data can be best exploited to enable reuse, replication, verification of results, any kind of scrutiny.\nSo they’re really, really important because a huge amount of money and time is invested into generating research data globally.\nAnd if that data isn’t findable, if it can’t be accessed, if it doesn’t interoperate, then essentially it isn’t reusable - and that sort of means that it’s a huge financial loss for global research as well as a bit of a setback for research progress.\nSometimes there are legal, ethical or commercial reasons why research data cannot be made publicly accessible.\nAnd FAIR data doesn’t always mean open data. So even where data has to be restricted to only allow access to certain people, or maybe even no people, the really important thing is that the metadata that describes that data is made available.\nNow, when we use the term metadata, what we mean is all of the information that builds up a picture about what that item or that data set might be. So a really good way of thinking about metadata is thinking about things that you use in your everyday life. So for example, you might have a record collection that you have organised according to different things.\nSo you might have put it in alphabetical order according to the name of the artist, or you might have put it into different sections for classical, pop, rock, for example. Or you might simply have just done it in a colour order to make it look like a pretty rainbow and all of those are ways of organising information using different types of metadata in order to be able to find things and understand things more easily.\nAnd we do the same things with information that includes data sets, but also would be things like publications, so every published piece of research will have rich metadata assigned to it.\nWhen it comes to research data, that information is really, really important, because in terms of transparency, allowing people to understand how you created your data, what the data is - and pretty key to this is - how they can reuse it, is really important.\nTo make your data FAIR, there are a few really key steps that come at different points in your research process. So right at the beginning of your research project, before you’ve even started collecting your data, we would always advise that you write a data management plan. And that plan should outline how you’re going to look after your data during your project, and then what’s going to happen to it after your project.\nIn terms of what happens after your project, the best piece of advice for making your data FAIR, would be to deposit it in a trusted digital repository. And you should do this whether your data is going to be openly available to the public, or whether it’s going to have a restricted access placed upon it.\nThe reason why we say that you should put your data into a trusted digital repository is because it will provide you with a persistent identifier like a DOI, which will ensure findability and accessibility of your data.\nIn terms of reusability, it will also enable you to assign an open license to your data, so that people can understand what the terms of free use are, and they know what they are and aren’t allowed to do with that data when they access it.\nAnd finally, in terms of interoperability, what’s really important is that you use those DOIs or those persistent identifiers that you are provided with by your repositories, or by your publishers, to link your different outputs. So we want to see you linking your data sets with your publications, with your other outputs, with your software, for example, and your materials.\nThat’s a really important aspect of FAIR.\nBut, to start from the beginning, the data management plan is a really solid way to start.\n\n\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nIsabel explains that the FAIR principles make the best use of expensively acquired global research findings, given the limits to openness. She explains the key concept of ‘metadata’: something that allows you to organise your research data and publications. She advises researchers to write a data management plan at the outset of their study, and to place the material in a trusted digital repository at the end of the study (you will learn more about this later).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause for thought\n\n\n\nData shouldn’t just be FAIR for humans. It needs to be FAIR for machines as well. Take ten minutes to think about the implications of living in a world that’s becoming more and more computationally intensive, and where global research data is being generated so quickly that humans struggle to keep up. How can you organise your own open data so computers are able to find it without human intervention? When you are ready, press ‘reveal’ to see our comments.",

    "text": "2.4 Licensing data\nIn the video, Isabel Chadwick recommended that when researchers share their data, they should choose a license to apply to the data. A license is a set of rules and permissions that tells you how you can use someone else’s data. It is like an agreement between the person who created the data (the data owner) and the person who wants to use it (the data user).\nA license specifies what you can and cannot do with the data, whether or not you need to give attribution to the data owner, and whether or not you can further share the data. For example, a common open license used for research data is CC BY-NC 4.0, which allows the person using your data to share and adapt the data, but only if they give attribution to you, the data owner, and don’t use the data for commercial purposes.\nThere are other types of license, which allow you to specify different levels of openness. You can choose to give your work over to the public domain, so people can do whatever they like with it. Alternatively, you can choose a type of license which prevents users from adapting your work. You can find out more about licensing by referring to this helpful list on the Creative Commons website.\n\nActivity 1\nAllow about 10 minutes\nIn this activity, you can test your understanding of considering anonymity when it comes to data sharing.\nIn an interview study about criminal experiences, three types of data are generated.\n\nA. Edited transcripts form the interview, with identifiable information removed\nB. Videos of people being interviewed\nC.

    "text": "2.5 Where to share data?\nIn the video, Isabel Chadwick explained that it is best practice to archive data and materials in an open access repository to make your research accessible. Whether you choose an institutional repository or a discipline’s repository, these trusted digital platforms provide a safe way to store research materials and data, and link to related content held elsewhere.\nThere are different repositories for different research fields and different types of data, but some examples are the Open Science Framework, the Qualitative Data Repository, and Zenodo. Here is an example of how to share data and materials on the Open Science Framework. The Open University also has its own repository (ORDO) where data and materials from researchers at The Open University can be shared.\nCase Studies\n\n\n\nChemistry\nThis study by Lia et al. (2020) investigates the structure and mechanisms of one enzyme involved in the chain of reactions through which our bodies metabolise glucose. All the data in this study are openly available with the paper, which directs readers to RCSB Protein Data Bank and Zenodo for underlying data and extended data.\n\n\nPsychology\nPLAY (Play & Learning Across a Year) is a project that aims to explore infants and their mother’s natural behaviours in their homes, across 50 universities in the United States. All materials, home visit protocols and the video and questionnaire data collected are all openly available on their website.\n\n\nArt\nQuantitative and qualitative data and software related to an Open University PhD thesis by Kanter (2024) have been shared openly on ORDO. This thesis was about British portraiture in the 1900s.\n\n\n\n\nActivity 2\nAllow around 10mins\nIn this activity, you will get the opportunity to explore an open access repository.\nHave a look online for some open data and materials, preferably in your field of research. One way of doing this is to use keywords to search for projects on ZENODO. Use the ‘search records’ box at the top to select your keywords, and use ‘resource types’ to filter your search so that it only includes datasets. Think of ways you could use the research products you find to answer a question that interests you.\nWhen you are ready, see our comments below.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Exploring an open access repository\nYour response will depend on your discipline and interests, and those of the researchers whose work you found. You might decide to use the data to generate new knowledge by analysing the original researchers’ datasets in new ways, or by running a related study based on their materials.\n  \n\n\n\nExample of using data from Open Science Framework\nHere’s a real-life example of using data from the Open Science Framework platform for a secondary data analysis.\nPrinzing (2024) reused data from an experience sampling study (where participants are repeatedly asked about their daily experiences related to a particular topic) on pro-environmental, sustainable behaviour. Prinzing used these data to investigate whether engaging in sustainable behaviour increased a person’s wellbeing. They shared some of the original data that they used and their analysis code on a separate OSF project. There are a few other things they could have done: they did not share a data dictionary, and they didn’t apply a license to the materials on their OSF project.\nNevertheless, the author of this course, Silverstein (2020), was able to reproduce the analyses from Prinzing (2024) using their data and code. Interestingly, in the process of conducting this reproduction, Silverstein found a typo in one of the values in the paper! The authors have now updated this.",

Assessing reproducibility means assessing the value or accuracy of a scientific claim based on the original methods, data, and code. So, when you run the same analyses on the same data, do you get the same results?\nRunning the same analyses on the same data can mean different things depending on what materials the reproducer has access to. Investigating the reproducibility of a study can mean taking the original data and:\n\nFollowing the description of analyses in the paper.\nFollowing an analysis plan created by the original authors.\nRe-running the analysis code that has been shared with the data.\n\nAs you can imagine, it’s easier to get the same results as the original researchers if there is less uncertainty around what they did. So, re-running the analysis code will be more likely to produce the same results than following the description of analyses in the paper. Going back to our baking analogy, it would usually be easier to produce the same cake as a professional chef if they shared the recipe they used than if they just described what they did, and the more detail they provided in the recipe, the easier it would be. However, even if a professional chef shared both a detailed recipe and a description of what they did, your cake might end up with a soggy bottom! Similarly, in research, when we have both the code and the data, it can still be difficult to reproduce results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake it more likely for other researchers to reproduce results of your study\n\n\n\n\nShare a data dictionary – list all the variables in your dataset, what they mean, how they were manipulated, and how they’re structured\nAnnotate your code – make notes of what you did at each stage of the data pre-processing and analysis and why\nMake a note of software versions – analyses might stop working with future versions\nMake sure your data and code are suitably licensed – for example, a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license means that anyone can share or adapt the material as long as they give you appropriate credit and do not use the materials for commercial purposes.\n\n\n\n\nActivity 3\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nThis activity will allow you to test your understanding of reproducibility.\nYou have been hired to run a reproduction of a study, and your goal is to ensure that the results are reproducible before a journal publishes it.

The paper comes with shared data but no code, however there is a detailed analysis plan explaining exactly which analyses were done in which order, and a data dictionary describing exactly how the data are named and structured.\nB. The paper comes with shared data and code, but the code is from over 10 years ago and doesn’t specify which version of the software it used. The code isn’t annotated and there is no data dictionary. Variable names in the data don’t match what’s in the code.\nC.

You don’t have much to work with at all: you have neither the code nor a detailed analysis plan. It will be very difficult to make sure you’re doing the exact same analysis as the authors, and so you’re a lot less likely to get the exact same results.\nIn Scenario 2, although you have the code, it is old and doesn’t say which software version it used. You’re likely to run into errors when you try to run the code (the software may have changed since the code was originally written). Because the code isn’t annotated and there isn’t a data dictionary, it will be very hard to work out what the different sections of code are trying to do, meaning a lower likelihood of being able to ‘debug’ the code if you run into errors.\nScenario 3 gives the best chance of reproducing the original study’s findings. Although the original code hasn’t been shared, there is a detailed analysis plan and data dictionary, so you should be able to work out which variables are which, and follow what the authors did in their original analyses. Because there isn’t existing code, you won’t run into errors with the code not running, although you might get slightly different numbers due to different software versions having slightly different ways of running analyses (e.g. different default settings).",

You might measure how quickly people respond to stimuli on a computer, or how much people would be willing to pay for a certain item.\nOpen data and materials can mean something quite different in qualitative research. This type of research focuses on patterns and themes in non-numerical data such as words, images, or observations. Imagine you are taking part in a qualitative study and are being interviewed about something close to your heart or your experiences. Try to imagine a topic that feels personal or emotive. Your data – instead of being a number – would be the actual words you said.\n\nHow would you feel if you took part in an interview study about an emotive topic and your data was made open and accessible?\nAre there any situations where you would be happy for your data to be open?\nAre there any situations where you definitely wouldn’t want your data to be open?\n\n Write down your thoughts in your notes.\n\nActivity 4\nAllow about 20 minutes.\nNow read the vignette below, about a qualitative researcher considering sharing their data. Consider the benefits of making the data open, and the ethical issues that the researcher should consider.\n\nA researcher is conducting a qualitative study with LGBTQ+ students about their experiences of mental health problems. The students that participated took part in in-depth interviews, which were video recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.

Making the full interviews open and accessible can increase the likelihood of participants being identified.\nParticipants only gave consent for their data to be used in this study, and did not have the opportunity to consent to their data being shared openly.\nVideo recordings were made, but these are even more likely to make participants identifiable so likely shouldn’t be shared.\nWill participants be less likely to discuss their experiences if they know the data will be open?\n\n  \n\n\n\nHow can qualitative researchers overcome these challenges?\nWe hope the suggestions in this section have helped you think about this. Qualitative researchers should consider using a data management plan at research inception, carefully anonymising their data, licensing the data or only making the data available to other researchers on request, getting consent from participants for open data up-front.\nJust as quantitative researchers aspire to make their research repeatable, for qualitative researchers, a bit of forward planning is important to make studies as transparent as they can be.",

    "text": "3.1 Replicability\nIn Week 1, we broke down the idea of open research into three key facets that make research open: transparency, integrity and accessibility. We’re now going to take a deeper dive into integrity: how trustworthy a study is.\nIn this week, you will learn how to recognise and avoid questionable research practices. You will discover why it is often important to be able to replicate other researchers’ findings, and how to go about doing this. You will experience an important test for the integrity of a piece of research: its .\nThere may be cases where you don’t expect to get the same results if you conduct the same study again. For example, if a study is based around a specific political event, it may be difficult or even impossible to replicate. But in many other types of investigation, we would expect to be able to get the same results when we run the same study again.\nIn Week 2, we talked about reproducibility – being able to get the same results when conducting the same analyses on the same data as the original study. Replicability is similar, in that it’s about getting the same results as the original study when running the same analyses, however, the difference is that now these analyses are run on new data. So, replication means conducting the same study again, and seeing if you get the same results.\nReplication studies are deliberate attempts to do this. But what does the ‘same study’ mean? There are always going to be differences between the original study and the replication study. Replication studies vary on a spectrum from ‘direct’ to ‘conceptual’. Direct replications try to stay as close to the original study as possible, whereas conceptual replications purposefully vary some aspects to better understand the underlying phenomenon. Here are some examples, from most direct (the first) to most conceptual (the last):\nNow let’s dig deeper into the process of designing a replication study.",

    "text": "3.2 Replication studies\nIn the next video, psychologist Priya Silverstein talks about their first forays into conducting a replication study, and lessons learned. As you watch the video, think about what Priya’s results tell us about the process of running a good replication study.\n Download the video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo transcript\n\n\n\n\n\nHi everyone, my name’s Priya Silverstein and I’m a post-doctoral researcher for the Psychological Science Accelerator, and I’m also the author for this course. My pronouns are ‘they, them’.\nAs part of my PhD, I ran my first replication study. It wasn’t meant to be a big part of my PhD, but it ended up being one of the biggest parts!\nI thought that before starting any of my own original research, it would make more sense to start with a replication study. However it wasn’t that simple, so when I ran the replication study, surprisingly, we got a null result, and I was a bit confused about why this might be. So the first thing that I did was I contacted the original researchers to ask them what they thought might be the problem.\nThey got back to me and they said that they thought it was because of some differences between the stimuli, so the things that I’d shown in my study versus the things that they showed in the original. And some of these differences were things I couldn’t have known, because they didn’t outline the specifics of that in their original paper.\nI made some edits to the protocol to the way that I was going to run the study.\nAnd then I thought, okay, now that I’ve had approval from the original authors this new version should be able to replicate the original study. So I ran it again and surprisingly I still wasn’t able to replicate the result.\nErm and so this was quite disappointing, both for me and the original authors, because it meant that I wasn’t able to find the same thing that they did.\nSo… This was my first experience of replications. And you might think that that was enough to put me off doing any more, but instead, quite the opposite. I ended up realising how important replications are.\nSo yeah, ever since starting with that first replication study as part of my PhD, I’ve now kind of made that my specialty.\nMy advice for anyone who would be conducting their own replication study comes from some of the mistakes that I made as part of that first replication study that I did.\nSo my first piece of advice would be to always contact the authors before you begin your replication study.\nI think I was a bit naïve, and thought if I just follow what’s written in the paper then how can I go wrong? But papers don’t have enough space to include everything about a study that you would need to know in order to conduct a good replication.\nSo I’d recommend talking to the original authors, coming to an agreement with them, making sure that they agree that the protocol that you’ve proposed, they would agree that’s a good faith replication attempt of their study.\nAnother thing that I did wrong is that I only collected the same number of participants as in the original study, for my replication, because I thought that was more ‘replication-y’, because it was the same amount of participants as the original. But now, after learning more about both replication studies, but also sample size more generally, I would really recommend to go with a much larger sample than the original study that you’re replicating.\nAnd this is just so that you can be a little bit more sure about what your findings mean. So, in my study, I wasn’t able to replicate the same result as the original authors, but this could just be because the true effect size that’s in the world for that effect that I was looking at might be smaller than what they kind of measured in the original study.\nIf I had used a much larger number of participants, if I still wasn’t able to replicate the study, we could be a bit more sure that it wasn’t just because of low sample size.\nI ran my study just as a normal study where we finished the entire study and then submitted it to a journal for publication. And I was lucky that it was successful in getting published.\nBut it could have been a lot harder for me to publish, which would have been a bit disappointing and taken a lot of time. So what I would recommend instead is submitting any replication study as a registered report.\nA registered report is essentially where your paper gets peer-reviewed before you have collected data. So the peer reviewers say whether your protocol makes sense, recommend any suggested changes, and then once they’ve accepted it, the journal agrees to accept your study, regardless of what the outcome is. So that would be my third piece of advice.\n\n\n\nVideo 2: Conducting a replication study\nWrite your comments on what Priya advises. Allow about 10 minutes. When you are ready, see our comments.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Advice from Priya\n  \nPriya suggests getting in touch with the authors of the original study and asking for more detail than a published paper provides. Using a larger sample size increases confidence that your findings do (or don’t) support those of the previous study. Priya also recommends submitting a registered report, to increase your chances of getting published. \n  \n\n\n3.2.1 Limits to replication\nThere are fields and methodologies where the value of replication is hotly debated. For instance:\n\nSome argue that replication should be encouraged in qualitative research, whereas others argue that there are still open questions about whether replication is possible, desirable, or even aligned with the fundamental principles of qualitative research.\nEconomics has had a long history with replication studies, but not under this name. In economics, replication often takes place as ‘robustness checks’, where researchers test if their results hold when they use different datasets.\nResearch in the humanities is primarily interpretive and context-specific, focusing on understanding human experiences, cultures, texts, and historical events. This interpretive nature makes exact replication more challenging.\n\nIt is important to think carefully about whether replication makes sense for your field and methodology.\nIf you are working in a field where replication is important, and if your study replicates the one you are trying to replicate, you can be pretty confident about the result.\nBut what does it mean if, like Priya’s first attempts, your study does not replicate? One explanation could be that the original result was a false positive , and so the failed replication is a ‘true negative’. Another explanation is that the replication result was a false negative, and that the original study was a ‘true positive’. It’s also possible that differences between the two studies are responsible for the different results.\n\nActivity 1\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nThis activity relates to our examples of typical direct and conceptual replication studies. By way of reminder:\nResearcher A finds a surprising finding in their research. To test whether they should rely on this result, they conduct a replication immediately after, using all the same materials and the same participant pool. This is a direct replication.\nResearcher B wants to replicate a study they’ve read about. They don’t think the original study was well-designed, but they think the hypothesis is interesting, so they design a new study testing the same hypothesis but in a different way. This is a conceptual replication.\nNow imagine these two researchers both carry out their studies. List the reasons why each of these two researchers may not replicate the original result.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Why were the two researchers unable to replicate the original results?\nYou might have listed: \n\n The original result was a false positive\n The replication result is a false negative\n There are important differences between the original study and the replication study:\n\na. These could be small changes that researchers didn’t think should be important but that turned out to be (e.g.: which brand of a specific chemical was used).\nb. It could be that the replication researcher didn’t realise these were differences because there wasn’t enough detail in the original paper to be able to work out how everything had been done.\nc. The replication researcher might know they’re making a change from the original protocol, but approve this change because theoretically it shouldn’t make a difference to the result.",

    "section": "3.3 The replication crisis",
    "text": "3.3 The replication crisis\nThis section will highlight some of the issues around replication in quantitative research. Replication is possible in qualitative research, and many qualitative researchers see the value of replication. So if you are a qualitative researcher, this section is still relevant to you. It will allow you to explore key issues faced by quantitative colleagues, learn how to read quantitative research papers more critically, and think about whether these issues could also apply to qualitative research, albeit manifested differently.\nIf we consider relatively direct replications, using the same materials as the original authors but conducted by different researchers, what percentage of published results do you imagine would replicate? It would be tempting to think that most published research findings are true, and therefore that a replication of a published research finding would be pretty likely to find the same result. However, researchers have found these percentages of findings could not be replicated:\n\nPsychology: up to 60%\nCancer biology: up to 55%\nEconomics: up to 40%\nPhilosophy: up to 30%\n\nThe number of studies that could not be replicated was much higher than expected in certain fields, which has led some to refer to this as a ‘replication crisis’.\nWhy is it that so many quantitative studies cannot be replicated? It’s complicated!\nPreviously, you learned the three classifications of failed replications: the original result was a false positive, the replication result was a false negative, or differences between the two studies could have been responsible for the different results. However, these three interpretations are not all as likely as each other. There are ways to try and work out which of these are most likely.\nThe original result being a false positive is more likely than you would think. Researchers often do not publish all the research that they do. As a researcher, there is an incentive to publish papers in ‘high impact’ journals (journals that are regarded highly in the researcher’s discipline, and that publish papers that receive a high number of citations). Historically, it has been harder to publish negative (null) results than positive (statistically significant) results, as journals have prioritised headline-grabbing results that confirm popular or contemporary positions. This has been the case for all journals, but especially high-impact ones.\nThis means that researchers have an incentive to get positive results in their research and can feel disappointed, stressed, and even ashamed if they don’t get a significant result. This can entice them to turn to questionable research practices, to increase the likelihood of a false positive result.",

    "text": "3.4 Questionable research practices\nYes, you read the end of the previous section correctly. There are questionable research practices that researchers may feel pressurised to use. Here are some examples:\n\nP-hacking: in quantitative research, p-hacking means exploiting techniques that increase the likelihood of obtaining a statistically significant result, for example by performing multiple analyses, or stopping data collection once a significant p-value is reached.\nSelective reporting: when results from research are deliberately not fully or accurately reported, in order to suppress negative or undesirable findings. For example, researchers might run two analyses but only report the one with significant findings, or be selective in what results are included in a report aimed at particular audiences.\nHARK-ing: is a shortening of ‘hypothesising after the results are known’. This is when researchers write their papers as if they had hypotheses that they then went on to test in their study, when really they made up the hypothesis after seeing their results, to pick one that best fit.\nPost-hoc justifications: means stating, after the fact, justifications for decisions made during the research project. For example, if the researcher only managed to recruit women for a study after trying to recruit all genders, but claimed in the paper that this was intentional.\n\nAlthough pressures to publish can sometimes be seen as barriers to transparency, the benefits of writing transparently can also be seen as a positive incentive, as the next section shows.",

    "section": "3.5 Writing transparently",
    "text": "3.5 Writing transparently\nWhen writing manuscripts, researchers should aim to be as transparent as possible, being honest about what happened in the study, how it was conducted, and when and why decisions were made. By using questionable research practices, researchers make it more likely that they get a false positive result, which can partially explain low replicability rates.\nIn the video, Priya introduced another important consideration for evaluating replication results: sample size (the number of samples in your study, e.g. participants). Smaller sample sizes make it more likely to get both a false positive and a false negative result. This is because smaller sample sizes provide less information about the population you are studying, which increases the variability and uncertainty in your results. With a small sample, the random variation (or ‘noise’) can more easily overshadow the true effect you are trying to measure. This means you might detect an effect that isn’t really there, a false positive, or miss an effect that actually exists, a false negative.\nFor instance, imagine trying to judge the average height of a population by looking at just a few individuals. Your estimate is more likely to be off compared to measuring a larger group, because you may happen to have either a very tall or very short person in your sample. So, if you have an original study with a small sample size and a (well-designed) replication with a large sample size, you could be more confident in the result of the replication than the result of the original study.\n\nActivity 2: What not to do!\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nSo far, you have considered good and bad writing practices. With these in mind, have a go at this ‘hack your way to scientific glory’ activity. First, choose a political party: Republican or Democrat (UK equivalents: Conservative or Labour). Then predict whether the party has a positive or negative impact on the economy. When you have done that, change aspects of the research (e.g. participant inclusion criteria and how you’re measuring your dependent variable) and see whether you can find a significant result (p &lt; 0.05) in your predicted direction.\nThe reason this is an example of ‘what not to do’ is because when you first choose a political party and predict whether they will have a positive or negative impact on the economy, you are forming a hypothesis. But, if you then play around with the data until you get the result that you wanted, and only stop when you do, then you are fixing the result.\nThe activity involves various questionable research practices, such as P-hacking, HARK-ing, selective reporting. However, there is a way to do different analyses on the same data without any of these being a problem. If instead of deciding on a hypotheses first then confirming it, you were to conduct purely exploratory research (without a hypothesis) you could be transparent about all of the different ways you looked at the data and how the results differed when you tried different things. This could even lead to people conducting their own future studies to confirm your exploratory results!\nWhen reading an academic paper, it’s important to read with a critical mindset and feel free to disagree with the methodological or analysis strategy, the interpretation of the results, or the conclusions drawn. Although we know that there are rare instances of outright fraud in science, we would expect that the researchers are truthfully describing what happened in the study, how it was conducted, and when and why decisions were made.",

    "section": "3.6 Generalisability",
    "text": "3.6 Generalisability\nYou have learned that replication studies vary on a spectrum from ‘direct’ to ‘conceptual’. However, most replication studies have some differences from the original study, even if these weren’t intentional. Consider one of the examples from before, where a researcher was replicating a paper from the 1990s. The materials they create will be different from the original materials, and if what they’re studying is context-dependent, a lot might have changed since then.\nFor example, a study on internet usage habits conducted in the 1990s would yield very different results if replicated today, due to the dramatic changes in technology and how people use the internet. Similarly, a study examining public attitudes toward mental health in the 1990s might produce different findings now because societal awareness and acceptance of mental health issues have evolved significantly over the past few decades.\nFor this reason, some consider that most replication studies are actually generalisability studies. Generalisability means whether a particular result generalises beyond the specific participants and conditions of the study to broader groups of samples, settings, methods, or measures. For example, if we’re interested in public attitudes to mental health, it wouldn’t make sense for us to only ask people aged 50-60, or only men, or only those living in cities. It’s possible that any of these characteristics could affect people’s opinions on mental health, meaning the results would be biased and not representative of the full population.\nWithout generalisability studies, it might be possible that the theoretical explanation for why the finding occurred might be incorrect. For example, there could even be a mistake in the design of the study that biased the results. For instance, imagine a biological study investigating the effects of a new drug using a specific strain of lab mice. If this particular strain has a unique genetic mutation that makes it respond differently to the drug compared to other strains, the study’s results might not generalize to other mice or to humans. This could lead to an incorrect conclusion about the drug’s overall effectiveness and safety.\nResearchers wishing to be transparent when writing their papers should declare possible ‘Constraints on generality’ in the discussion section. This could take the form of a statement that identifies and justifies the target populations for the reported findings, and other considerations the authors think would be necessary for replicating their result. This could help other researchers to sample from the same populations when conducting a direct replication, or to test the boundaries of generalisability when conducting a conceptual replication.",

    "text": "3.7 Studying generalisability\nSo you think your research has potential do good in the world, but don’t know how widely it can be applied? There are lots of different ways to study generalisability:\n\nSystematic reviews: these look at how an outcome varies in the published literature across samples, settings, measures and methods (meta-analyses do this statistically). This can be done without conducting any new studies. For example, UNICEF’s Evidence and Gap Map Research Briefs provide an overview of available evidence of the effectiveness of interventions to improve child well-being in low- and middle-income countries.\nComparative studies: comparing results from different populations using the same (adapted) materials can show where there may be similarities and differences. For example, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory, which identified and measured cultural differences across countries, particularly in the workplace context.\n\nBig team science: when researchers from around the world conduct the same study and pool their results, they can look at various factors affecting the presence or size of the effect they’re interested in. For example, the first ManyGoats project is examining goat responses to different human attentional states, and will be testing a diverse range of goats in different living conditions.\n\n\nActivity 3\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nThink about a study in your field that would or wouldn’t generalise. Consider why this might be the case.\nTake some notes of your thoughts first, and see our discussion.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \n  Why a study may or may not generalise\nThere are lots of reasons why a study may or may not generalise. Imagine a study evaluating a new therapy for depression in a university clinic with primarily urban-based participants.\n\nWhile the therapy showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms over ten weeks among a diverse sample, including college students and middle-aged adults of various ethnicities recruited through local health centres and university channels, its applicability to other populations and settings may be limited. Factors such as regional differences in mental health resources, demographic diversity beyond the studied age groups, and recruitment biases could affect the therapy's effectiveness in rural or suburban areas and among older adults or adolescents.",

    "text": "4.1 Preregistration: publishing your plans for a study\nThis week is about ways to make your research more transparent. As you discovered earlier, transparency means being clear about exactly what you did at every stage of your research. However, over the course of an entire research project (typically months to years), it’s highly likely that you will forget certain aspects of how the study was conducted, and when and why decisions were made.\nOne of the most important ways you can make sure that others will be able to replicate your research is by keeping detailed records of all aspects of the project, and updating them as you go. It’s a bit like keeping a record of the twists and turns you made while going through a maze. Without detailed notes, remembering all the decisions you made at every stage of your research project can be difficult. You will build up a lot of information, which can be hard to compile once you get to the writing stage.\nThe most important distinction is whether decisions were made before or after data collection begins. This is because when researchers are able to look at the data they can be swayed by what they see. Preregistration (Registration in some fields) is the practice of publishing the plan for a study, including research questions, {{&lt;term “Hypothesis1|hypotheses”&gt;}}, research design, and data analysis plans before the data has been collected or examined.\nA preregistration document is time-stamped and typically registered with an independent party (e.g., an open access repository) so that it can be publicly shared with others. Preregistration provides a transparent documentation of what was planned at a certain time and allows third parties to assess what changes may have occurred afterwards. Importantly, it’s fine for changes to occur, it’s just important to know when and what these were, and why these changes were made.\nHaving a more detailed preregistration leaves fewer {{&lt;term “Freedom|research degrees of freedom”&gt;}}. In other words, the more detailed a preregistration is, the better third parties can assess any possible changes and how they may affect confidence in the results.\nOne platform for preregistering research is the Open Science Framework (OSF). On the OSF there are support videos and documentation to guide you through the process. You can use a variety of templates depending on your discipline and methodology to preregister your study in varying levels of detail. These templates include:\nIf none of the available templates suit you, you can write your own document and preregister this in an open-ended preregistration!",

They are useful for discovering patterns in that data or extending to new topics or subjects. They foster hypothesis development and refinement.\nPreregistration often aims to clearly distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses. This is helpful because you won’t be able to convince yourself (or others) that you had hypotheses before you saw your data, when actually you added these ‘post-hoc’, after seeing the results.\nIf you are thinking of preregistering either type of research, here are some things to consider:\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative research can be confirmatory, and so preregistration for confirmatory research can be used for both.\nFor exploratory research, preregistration can be a great way to document initial study plans, even if those later change through an iterative process.\nPreregistering exploratory studies can be useful for both quantitative and qualitative research, for all disciplines.\nIf your discipline has another good way of keeping track of how study plans change over the course of the research, then this could also work well instead of preregistration.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analysis so that results can be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\n4.1.2 How to approach preregistration\nWhether your work is confirmatory or exploratory, preregistering keeps a permanent record of your ideas at the design stage, before you start the analysis.\nThe process of preregistering involves answering a series of questions about your research. There are many templates of preregistration forms available. In the next activity, we will walk you through some typical questions.\nWhen answering the questions, you should aim to be as precise and detailed as possible. By doing this, you are being transparent about your research plans from the outset. The benefits include establishing a clear and detailed plan for your research, that you can revisit and update as you make your way through your research project.\nA detailed and comprehensive preregistration demonstrates that you haven’t engaged in the questionable research practices that you learned about in the last week, and can be useful for reviewers and readers when they assess the integrity of your research.",

    "text": "Activity 1: Preregistration\nAllow about 30 minutes.\n Time to get your notebook ready.\nIn the activity below, you will gain experience of the type of information you will need to provide when preregistering a research project. Please answer the questions based on one of your existing research projects, or a project you would like to do in the future.\n1.1 What is your research project title?\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nThe title of your research project should, in ten to fifteen words, provide an informative description of the research being reported. When coming up with the title you might want to think about the variables, the design of the study, and the key findings of your research project.\n  \n\n1.2 Who is contributing to this research?\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nIf you are collaborating with people on this research project, you can list their names and affiliations here. Declaring these provides contextual information about your research, and the academic perspectives the people in your team are likely to bring to it.\n  \n\n1.3 Have any data been collected for this study already?\nThis question concerns whether you have already collected data. There are three possible options: select the one that best describes the stage you are at with your research, write your own notes on further details, then click ‘Show / Hide Discussion’ to see our comments.\n\na) Yes, at least some data has been collected for the study already.\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nYou may need to explain how much exposure to the data you've had: the general rule of thumb is the less involvement you’ve had with the data, the better. However this does depend on your project, and preregistration can still protect you from questionable research practices, even if some data has already started to come in.\n  \n\n\nb) No, no data have been collected for the study already.\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nGreat! When you are preregistering, the general rule of thumb is the less involvement you’ve had with data, the better. That way, you won’t be tempted to add post hoc justifications after you’ve seen the results.\n  \n\n\nc) It’s complicated because we have already collected some data or are using secondary data.\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nIf you select this third option, you’ll need to explicitly state how, and to what capacity, you’ve been exposed to the data previously. When you are hoping to preregister, the general rule of thumb is the less involvement you’ve had with the data, the better, but a project that involves secondary data is a good example of how preregistration can still be valuable, even when a lot of data already exists.\n  \n\nNow let’s continue our walk through preregistration. The next question gets to the heart of the matter: what your research is about. You need to be clear and concise in your responses, so that when you return to your preregistration document, it will clearly encapsulate what your plans were at this point in time.\n1.4 What is the main question being asked, or hypothesis being tested in the study?\n\nHere are some tips As you write your notes on your research question, here are some tips to help with your responses:\nYour research questions should be specific. If you have more than one {{&lt;term “Hypothesis1|hypothesis”&gt;}}, you need to write multiple statements (one per hypothesis). It is helpful to write hypotheses in bulleted or numbered format: this forces you to be concise. If you are doing quantitative research, you should also state whether your hypothesis predicts a certain direction and if so what that direction is.\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nYour response will vary according to your discipline and style of research. Try to ensure the research question or hypothesis is as focused as possible. Use simple language and avoid ambiguity. Here is an example:\n\nResearch question: Can we replicate the findings of Yoon, Johnson and Csibra \\[PNAS, 105, 36 (2008)\\] that nine-month-old infants retain qualitatively different information about novel objects in communicative and non-communicative contexts?\n\nHypothesis 1: In a communicative context (‘ostensive pointing’), infants will mentally process the identity of novel objects at the expense of mentally processing their location. We would expect longer looking times for changed objects than changed location.\n\nHypothesis 2: In a non-communicative context (‘non-ostensive reaching’), infants will mentally process the location of novel objects at the expense of encoding their identity. We would expect longer looking times to changed location than changed identity.\n\n\n\nNext, you’ll be asked questions about the design of your study. The first of these questions relates to quantitative research. If your research is not quantitative, you may wish to go to question 6 directly.\nThese are some questions you might want to ask yourself when answering: - What are your {{&lt;term “independentVar|independent variables”&gt;}} and your {{&lt;term “dependentVariable|dependent variables”&gt;}}? How do these variables relate to each other? - How will they be measured (a self-scale report, a behavioural task)? - What is your sample size and criteria? - How did you determine your sample size? - Do you have a {{&lt;term “between1|Between, within or mixed study design”&gt;}}? - Are you using Counterbalancing?\n1.5. Describe the design, key variables, and sample, specifying how they will be measured and collected.\nIn your notes, reflect on why you think this information is important for preregistration.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nYour response will vary according to your discipline and style of research. Here’s one example:\nIndependent variable: Our study investigates two conditions: communicative (ostensive pointing) and non-communicative (ostensive reaching).\n\nDependent variable: Duration of first looks and total looking time, measured using a Tobii eye-tracker. We may also hand-code looking offline (blind) to increase confidence in our results.\n\nDesign: Previous research has only found a significant effect for duration of first look, so we only predict differences in this. However, we are still including total looking time: although previous research data were not significant for this variable, they appear to be in the predicted direction.\n\nMeasurement: Duration from first video frame when object is revealed to when infant first looks off-screen.\n\nSampling: We will run the study until twenty four infants that meet the criteria for the experiment have been tested. This will exclude excessive fussiness preventing completion of study or resulting in uncodable eye movement, experimenter and equipment error, caretaker interference, or infants looking off-screen.\n\n\nIf your research is qualitative, you will also be asked to specify exactly how you plan to conduct your research, although your answers are likely to be a little different.\nFor instance, you might be interested in the experience of parenting a child prodigy. How will you approach the task? With a questionnaire? An interview? A focus group? Open or closed questions? Or supposing you are interested in changes in depictions of families through the twentieth century. What evidence will you use? Newspapers and magazines? Archive photographs? How will you analyse them? Discourse analysis? Visual analysis?\n1.6. Describe the study design and how data will be sampled and collected.\nAs you write your own notes documenting your design and data collection plan, here are some tips to help with your responses:\n\n\nWhat methodologies are you using, e.g.: case study, ethnography?\nWhat is your sampling, recruiting or case selection strategy?\nWhat type of data are you interested in, and what is your method for collecting or generating the data?\nYou may also want to describe tools, instruments, plans or schedules (e.g.: interview schedule or archival search plan)?\nWhat criteria need to be reached in order to stop data collection or generation?\n\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nYour response will vary according to your discipline and style of research. But asking yourself questions like this helps to focus on what you want to know, and how you will be exploring it. Here is one example of a preregistered qualitative study.\n  \n\nWe hope this activity has helped you feel confident about your next preregistration. These questions have concentrated on your methodology plan, but you will also need to provide information about your analysis plans. We will explore the analysis stage in more detail in the next week.",

    "text": "4.2 Reporting guidelines\nWe’ve talked about preregistration as a way to be transparent before you collect your data. How about once you’ve collected your data and are writing up your research? You should be honest about how you conducted your study, and anything that has changed since you planned (and perhaps preregistered) it. One way of being transparent when writing up your research is to use reporting guidelines.\nReporting guidelines are sets of rules or standards that help researchers present their findings clearly and transparently. They’re like a checklist that ensures all-important information about a study is included in a research paper. These guidelines vary depending on the type of study or field of research, but they generally help researchers communicate their methods, results and conclusions effectively, making it easier for others to understand and evaluate their work.\nHere are some reporting guidelines for different fields:\nSTROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology)\n\nSTROBE provides a checklist to enhance the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology, encompassing key aspects such as study design, participant selection, data collection methods, and statistical analysis.\n\nCOREQ (COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research)\n\nCOREQ provides a checklist of items that researchers should address when reporting qualitative research, covering aspects such as study design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.\n\nEQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research)\n\nEQUATOR provides a variety of reporting guideline templates for various branches of health research, including reporting guidelines for randomised trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, qualitative research, animal studies, economic evaluations, and more.\n\nThere are many benefits to using reporting guidelines. Most obviously, they help researchers to clearly and comprehensively communicate all the important information about their study. This is helpful for the researcher themselves, and for anyone else who wants to read, understand, and potentially build upon their work. However, if you’re unable to find reporting guidelines for your particular field, being as transparent as possible and including as much detail as possible is your best bet!\n\nActivity 2\nAllow about 30 minutes.\nIn the activity below, you get the chance to practise writing your own simple set of guidelines.\nImagine that your friend has some very important news to tell you. Create a set of reporting guidelines for them, so that they can make sure to include all relevant information about what happened and the people involved when telling you the news. Fill the reporting guidelines out for the piece of news to make sure the guidelines include everything you would need.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion \n  \n  \nHere’s an example of what this might look like:\n1. Briefly describe the news: Sanjay is moving to Argentina!\n2. Outline short descriptions of all people involved in this piece of news: Sanjay is a 30-year-old sociology researcher who currently lives in the UK.\n3. Outline important dates relevant to the news: Sanjay will be moving in September 2026.\n4. Provide any background reasoning for the news: Sanjay has been offered a research job in Argentina.",

Would the researcher (or the company funding the researcher) benefit from the results of the research coming out in a particular direction?\nHere are some examples of potential conflicts of interest:\nWhile it is common to disclose conflicts of interest, there are many fields where it isn’t common to consider how our experiences, perspectives, values, and biases might affect our research in a way that is less clear-cut.",

    "section": "5.2 Positionality",
    "text": "5.2 Positionality\nPositionality refers to an individual’s social and political position within society, including their identity, background, experiences, and beliefs. These factors can influence the way researchers perceive and interpret data, potentially impacting the research process and outcomes. Positionality is not always negative – a researcher can also be uniquely positioned to study something because they have a deeper lived understanding of it.\nHere are some positive and negative examples of ways that positionality could influence research:\n\nGender biases among medical professionals may affect the way certain health conditions are studied or treated.\nEconomic researchers’ ideological beliefs and political affiliations can shape their interpretations of data and policy recommendations.\nIndigenous researchers may offer traditional ecological knowledge that complements non-indigenous approaches, leading to innovative conservation strategies.\nAn activist-researcher may use their lived experience of living under a dictatorship when conducting a study on political systems.\n\n\n5.2.1 Positionality statements\nPositionality statements allow readers to assess the positionality of a researcher, and how it might affect their research. They are common in qualitative research, and are starting to be considered in quantitative research, too.\nResearchers can consider including a ‘positionality statement’ in papers, to contextualise themselves and their research environment, and define the boundaries of their research output. This can provide additional context around how the study was conducted, including the researcher’s experiences, perspectives, and potential biases.\nPositionality statements and conflict of interest statements both serve to disclose personal biases or influences that might affect an individual’s work or perspective. However, they differ in scope and intent. Positionality statements focus more heavily on the author’s social and cultural identity factors, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, to provide context on how these factors might influence their viewpoint. Conflict of interest statements, on the other hand, disclose financial or personal relationships that could compromise the integrity of one’s work or create a perception of bias. While both aim for transparency, positionality statements address broader socio-cultural influences, whereas conflict of interest statements specifically target potential financial or relational biases.\nQualitative researchers often talk about reflexivity – a researcher’s ability to reflect critically on their own position, and how it influences the research process. This is a key skill in the social sciences and other disciplines that use qualitative research methods for studying social interaction, interpersonal relations, or cultural practices. A dash of reflexivity is particularly helpful for writing a positionality statement: see this article for more on reflexivity and positionality statements.\n\nActivity 1\nAllow about 30 minutes\nWrite a positionality statement for yourself. You can do this for a research project you are involved in, one you have been involved in in the past, or for a fictional project in a field you are interested in.\nAs you do so, think about whether your positionality might influence the way you perceive and interpret the data in the project you have chosen, and whether it might impact the research process and outcomes in both negative and positive ways. For instance, your negative experience with police after being a witness to a crime might influence your interpretation of police data relating to lineup processes in a way that does not reflect reality. In contrast, your experience of having a child with a rare disease might help to ask the right questions when interviewing other parents with similar experiences.\n Write your positionality statement in your notes.",

    "section": "5.3 Flimsy interpretations?",
    "text": "5.3 Flimsy interpretations?\nIn Week 3, you learned how researchers can be biased towards statistically significant results, and results that fit with the story they are trying to tell in their paper. One of the ways to spot this is when results and conclusions don’t follow on from each other. Tenuous links between results and conclusions are not always obvious, but they will be easier to spot once you are familiar with papers in your particular research area. Here are some to avoid in your own research:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP-value interpretation\n\n\n\nIn quantitative papers where a specific p-value threshold is being used to determine whether a result is statistically significant or not, researchers should specify at the beginning of their analysis section what their threshold will be for interpreting significance (e.g. &lt; 0.05). It’s important that p-values are interpreted consistently throughout the analysis. For example, you shouldn’t find 0.05 being used to show a significant difference in one case, but not in another. Any statistical value that is larger than your identified threshold should not be presented as evidence of an effect or association, however much you may wish it to be so!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for theory\n\n\n\nSometimes, researchers can be so invested in a particular theory they are not able to see other ways their results could be interpreted. You should always try to think about alternative explanations for your results, and include these in the manuscript discussion. When reading other researchers’ papers, think about other possible interpretations of their results, and evidence for and against those different interpretations. It can be difficult to see theories outside your own position, so it is helpful to get other researchers with different experiences or expertise to read your work before submitting it. You can offer to do the same for them when they are writing a manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurying results\n\n\n\nSometimes researchers present several results in an article, but ‘cherry-pick’ which of these to highlight in the discussion, overemphasising results that fit the story they’re trying to tell in their paper, and underemphasising those that seem to be contradictory. It’s important that any contradictory results are included in the discussion section, with speculation about why they may have occurred.\n\n\nIn Week 3, we pointed out that these biases are largely due to problematic incentive structures in academia. Researchers are incentivised to publish exciting, significant results in their papers, as these are more easily accepted by highly-regarded journals. Knowing this, it isn’t surprising that researchers are often biased to tell a simple, effective story in their papers, even though research is messy!\nSlowly, the norms do seem to be shifting, so it is becoming more common to be fully transparent in your manuscript writing, by including potentially confusing results and being honest about uncertainties.\n\n5.3.1 Avoiding the pitfalls\nSometimes academic journals have specific word counts, and it can be difficult to fit a lot of nuance and several additional analyses into the body of the paper. Where this is the case, it can be helpful to include all this information as supplementary information accompanying the paper (e.g. as a document uploaded to the Open Science Framework) rather than in the paper itself.\nPreregistration, which you learned about in Week 4, can also help you to avoid the pitfalls described on the previous page. If you plan to use p-values to make conclusions about whether your statistical tests are significant or not, you will need to outline a significance threshold in your preregistration. You will also need to outline how you will interpret different results, including whether they will support a specific theory.\nPreregistration can also protect you from burying results that don’t support your conclusions: if you preregister that you will run certain analyses, you will need to report the results of these, regardless of what they were.\nImportantly, without anyone checking your preregistration, you could still make decisions in the preregistration that make your results less credible. For example, you could pick a very high significance threshold (e.g. p &lt; 0.1), which would make false positive results more likely. You could say that a result supports a theory that doesn’t make sense, or you could ‘bury’ additional analyses that negate the results you’d prefer to draw attention to, if they weren’t included in your preregistration. Preregistration doesn’t automatically give your work more integrity, but it can help you to think through your research decisions more clearly before you start, and stop you from tricking yourself later.\n\nActivity 2\nAllow about 30 minutes\nThink of a disagreement you’ve had with someone. Write down three versions of the disagreement: one where you’re completely right, one where the other person is completely right, and one where you explain the complicated truth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nReflect on the activity – was it more difficult to write someone else’s perspective rather than your own? How might this manifest in research? Might it be easier to write about how your results support your preferred theory than to think about alternatives? Could stepping into the shoes of another researcher help you to try to work out alternative explanations for your results?",

    "text": "5.4 Robustness\nRobustness refers to the strength and reliability of results. Results can be considered more robust (and therefore have more integrity) if they hold up under various conditions, e.g. different data analyses. When results are robust to different data analyses, this indicates that the conclusions drawn from the research are not overly dependent on specific features of one type of analysis, and are therefore likely more widely applicable.\n\n\n\nA ruined wooden bridge on the left and a cast iron bridge on the right. Let’s check the integrity of the bridges here. The bridge on the left is likely to be less robust to extreme weather events than the bridge on the right. Which would you rather cross?\n\n\nIn some fields, it’s common to run many robustness analyses. For example, in economics, it is typical to have dozens of pages of any paper showing that a particular result holds up no matter how you measure the variables, which participants you include, which statistical model you use, and even when you control for a variety of factors that could be an alternative explanation for the effect.\nHowever, in other fields it’s less common. For example, in psychology, papers are often published where only one key analysis is performed to examine the results. If data and materials aren’t shared openly, it means others outside of the original research team cannot even choose to run these analyses themselves to check the robustness of the results. This is a good example of how integrity is difficult to check without transparency.\n\n5.4.1 Multiverse analysis\nOne way to take robustness to its most extreme is to perform multiverse analysis. Although this sounds like something out of a science fiction movie about time travel - it’s actually a lot less out-of-this-world (however, still very cool). Multiverse analysis is where researchers try to perform all possible reasonable analyses on the data, in order to explore which analyses show the effect they’re interested in and which don’t.\n\nActivity 3\nAllow 10 minutes.\nUsing the hack your way to scientific glory activity from Week 3, try to write down as many different combinations of analysis parameters and the results you get from them (perform and write down as many as you can in 10 minutes). In effect, you will be doing a mini-multiverse analysis. What does it mean that the results are so variable, depending on the analysis performed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nThere are actually NINE HUNDRED different analysis combinations you could use in this activity! Conducting a full multiverse analysis on data like these would take a very long time, and go beyond the scope of the usual research project. But perhaps thinking about some of the most important robustness checks you could do with your research could be a first step towards enhanced robustness, without exploring the entire multiverse.",

It can influence the link between results and conclusions: when researchers interpret their data, there is a chance it could colour their interpretation. Potential researcher biases can also impact how researchers write up conclusions following on from their results. It’s important to try to avoid, or at least be explicit about potential biases in your own writing. Finally, robustness is whether or not results hold up in multiple analyses – where they do, we can have more confidence in the results. This helps researchers defend themselves against potential bias.\nIn Week 6 you’ll be moving on from the principle of integrity to the principle of accessibility.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "6.1 Open access\nIn Weeks 2 to 5 of this course, you have explored two key principles of open research: transparency and integrity. Now let’s turn to the third principle of accessibility. Accessibility is crucial, because knowledge generation is a collective endeavour, funded at least in part by taxpayers, and so everyone has a right to the knowledge that is generated. For this short course, accessibility will be discussed in the context of journal manuscripts, while acknowledging that research can also be made accessible through many other outputs.\nAccessible research in this context means ensuring that all who are interested can consume, evaluate, and otherwise interact with research products and processes. Even if research is transparent and has integrity, if only certain people can access the research products, it is not truly open.\nOne aspect of ensuring that all those who are interested are able to consume research products is open access, which refers to manuscripts being made freely available and reusable. If a manuscript is truly ‘open access’ then the author should have full copyright permissions, which means they can use the final manuscript however they wish.\nTo be reusable, the manuscript should be made available through a Creative Commons (also known as CC) licencing, which offers more flexible usage rights for your work. As you learned in Week 2, there are various types of license, ranging from fairly permissive (e.g.: others can access, copy, use and adapt the work as long as credit is given to the author), to more restrictive (e.g.: credit must be given to the author, non-commercial uses only, and the work cannot be altered). You can find out more about licensing on the Creative Commons website.\nAs well as being related to accessibility, you can consider open access to be another form of transparency. It makes manuscripts openly available, for the same reasons as you learned about in Week 2, for making data and materials openly available.\nImagine you’re in a library searching for a book that you need for an assignment. You find the perfect one on the shelf, but when you try to open it, the pages are glued together. You can see the cover and read the blurb, but the valuable content inside is completely inaccessible to you. This is what it’s like to not be able to access an article because it’s behind a paywall.\nOpen access can take many different forms:\nGreen open access 🟢\nWith green open access, the work is openly accessible from a public repository, such as a preprint server. This is a way researchers can provide access to their research without cost to themselves or their readers. Usually this means sharing a version of the manuscript openly (i.e. a version of the manuscript that has gone through the peer-review process, but has not been copy-edited or typeset by the publisher). The manuscript becomes freely available, either at the point of deposit or after a publisher’s embargo period, usually 6 to 24 months.\nGold open access ⭐️\nWith gold open access, the work is immediately openly accessible upon publication via the publisher’s website. Usually this means the researcher paying a fee to the publisher, which can be up to several thousand pounds. Some universities have a deal with certain publishers, and will pay this charge on behalf of the researcher.\nDiamond open access 💎\nDiamond open access (also known as platinum open access) is where an organisation covers the cost of publication so that neither the reader nor the author pays to read or publish. The work is immediately openly accessible upon publication via the publisher’s website, without cost to researchers or their readers.\nIf diamond open access is possible, why don’t more publishers offer it?",

    "section": "6.2 Journal publishing models",
    "text": "6.2 Journal publishing models\nThe reason why more publishers don’t offer diamond open access is because the different journals have different business models. Each journal will have a publisher, who plays a varying role in the operation and management of the journal. Publishers can be involved in editorial support, production and typesetting, distribution and access, marketing and promotion, financial management, copyright and licensing, and indexing and impact metrics.\nHere are some of the different business models for academic journals:\n\nTable: Journal Publishing – Business Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscription-based model:\nUnder this model, readers pay a subscription fee to access the journal's content. This fee could be paid by individuals, institutions like universities, or both. The journal may also offer print and online subscription options.\nSociety or Association-based model:\nMany journals are published by scholarly societies or professional associations. Depending on the society, the journal can either be a source of income for the society or association, or it can be financed by other sources of income.\n\n\nOpen Access model:\nIn this model, sometimes referred to by its acronym ‘OA’, the content of the journal is freely available to readers without requiring a subscription. Instead, the costs of publication are often covered by charging authors a fee, known as an ‘article processing charge’, or ‘APC’.\nAdvertising-supported model:\nIn this model, journals generate revenue by selling advertising space within their publications. Advertisers pay to reach the journal's audience, typically researchers, academics, and professionals in a specific field.\n\n\nHybrid model:\nJournals employing this model offer a combination of both subscription-based and open access options. Some articles are freely available (open access), while others require a subscription to access. Authors may choose to pay APCs to make their articles open access within a hybrid journal.\nPay-per-view model:\nSome journals offer individual articles for purchase on a pay-per-view basis. Readers can access specific articles by paying a fee for each article they wish to view, rather than subscribing to the entire journal.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 What help is available for authors when publishing in journals with an APC?\nSometimes, institutions and/or research funders are willing to pay the APCs for authors to publish Open Access. Some institutions even have ‘Transitional Agreements’ with publishers to cover these APCs. Similarly, the UKRI block grant provides funding for eligible authors to meet publishing costs. Many journals also offer ‘APC waivers’ for eligible authors who are unable to pay. For authors seeking further assistance, exploring their institutional guidance or speaking directly with library staff can help identify other potential funding opportunities tailored to their specific needs.\n\n6.2.1.1 The Big Five\nMany journals have a large publisher, e.g. Elsevier, Sage, Springer Nature, Taylor and Francis, and Wiley – the ‘big five’. These publishers are for-profit, meaning that they make a large amount of money from researchers (through APCs), universities (through subscriptions), or readers (through subscriptions and pay-per-view). For example, it has been estimated that the research community paid over $1.06 billion in open access fees alone to the big five publishers between 2015 and 2018.\n\n\nActivity 1\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nWrite down the advantages and disadvantages of each business model in terms of accessibility and open access to research. Which business model do you find the most concerning and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nThere are many nuanced advantages and disadvantages to the different models. For example, the open access model ensures that anyone can read the published articles, but isn’t very accessible to authors, since they may not have the funding to pay to publish in the journal. Solving this problem, hybrid models mean that authors do not have to pay to publish, but then their article would be paywalled, making the model less accessible to readers.\n  \n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Changing tides\nPeople have been working for years to build up open access publishing. Latin America is a global leader. Governments, foundations, and public universities in Latin America have fostered a vibrant culture of open access, with between fifty and ninety percent of articles published in the region appearing open access through platforms such as SciELO and Redalyc, typically as diamond open access.\nPlan S is an initiative launched by Coalition S, a group of international research agencies and funders from around the world. The goal is to make all publicly funded research freely available to everyone. Under Plan S, researchers who receive funding from Coalition S members must publish their work in open access journals or platforms.\nMore recently, academics have started developing independent journals, bypassing for-profit publishers. For example, the editorial team from the journal Lingua broke off from Elsevier and launched a new journal called Glossa.\nWhen publishing your research, one consideration of where to publish can be the values of the journal, and whether you want to contribute to further profits for a for-profit publisher or not. The next few sections explore some of your options.",

    "section": "6.3 Preprints",
    "text": "6.3 Preprints\nAlthough as researchers we can strive towards only publishing in open access journals that fully uphold our scientific values, life unfortunately is not that simple! As you learned in previous weeks, in academia, publishing in prestigious journals is incentivised, and impacts researchers’ ability to obtain grants, jobs and promotions. Unfortunately, what’s considered prestigious most often overlaps with for-profit publishers. This is why initiatives like DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment) and responsible metrics are crucial. Rather than evaluating research based on the impact factor of the journal, which promotes the merits of individual works, they advocate evaluating research based on its quality and placing value on a wider range of scholarly outputs.\nAlthough it might seem tempting to boycott all for-profit publishers (and many are doing this), it can be a balancing act for researchers to weigh up the relative costs and benefits of trying to publish in a prestigious journal. Those with more privilege – such as researchers with a permanent job, or enough savings or support to not worry about not having a job for a while – are able to be more radical in their approach, so it’s important to acknowledge that researchers have their individual circumstances to consider when deciding which journals to publish in, and more generally, which open research practices to engage in.\nPreprints are a way to ensure that your work is openly accessible to others, regardless of where you publish your research. A preprint is a version of your article that you submit to a preprint repository. There are preprint repositories in many fields, e.g. bioRxiv (pronounced ‘bio-archive’), PsyArXiv (pronounced ‘psy-archive’), and PhilPapers. There are also discipline non-specific repositories, e.g. OSF preprints. All you need to do is upload a version of your paper to the server, and it is available for anyone to read free! This is also a great way to showcase your work before waiting for it to be peer-reviewed and published in a journal, which can be especially beneficial to early-career researchers.\nYou can upload preprints for work that is already published in a journal, work that you’re submitting to a journal, and even work that you never intend to submit to a journal. There are different benefits to uploading preprints at these different stages:\n\nAlternative to a journal: If you’re not interested in publishing your paper in a peer-reviewed journal, or don’t have the time to do so, uploading it to a preprint server means that the research community can still read your findings and benefit from your hard work.\nAlongside submission to a journal: Submitting a preprint alongside submission to a journal gets your paper out there quicker than waiting for it to be peer-reviewed and published. If you submit a preprint before submitting to a journal, people outside of the journal’s reviewers can give informal feedback that you can implement in your journal submission (or in the next round of submission).\nAfter publishing in a journal: Submitting a preprint of work that has already been published in a journal means you can make your work green open access if it is currently published behind a paywall, meaning more people can read it.\n\nMany journals will allow you to publish a preprint of your work alongside submission to their journal, or after your article has been accepted in the journal. However, some journals will not. To check the rules for the journal that you’re interested in, enter the journal or publisher information in Open Policy Finder.",

    "text": "6.4 Preprint considerations\nPreprints are used to varying degrees across different fields of research, and in different ways within these fields, so it might be worth having a chat with your colleagues or educators to find out what the norms are in your field before deciding how and whether to upload your own preprints.\nIt’s important to consider that preprints that are published instead of, or alongside journal publication, have not always been peer-reviewed. This doesn’t automatically mean that they’re ‘worse’ than articles that have been peer-reviewed – many terrible manuscripts have slipped through peer-review, and many excellent ones have been rejected – but it does mean that readers should take the content with a pinch of salt and an even more critical eye than usual. This can be problematic when the public or journalists are interacting with preprints, as they might take the content as fact, which they shouldn’t even be doing for peer-reviewed work, let alone work that hasn’t been peer-reviewed.\n\nActivity 2\nAllow about 15 minutes.\nFind a preprint server for your discipline, or if one doesn’t exist then use OSF Preprints. Spend ten minutes looking for the most interesting article you can find, and identify which stage of the research process it has been uploaded to the preprint server. Use keywords you would usually use to search for an article in your discipline, just like searching for a published article. Tip: usually, researchers will identify on the title page if the article has been submitted to or accepted by a journal.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nHopefully you could see whether preprints were published before or after publication in a journal. Preprints can be an excellent way to access the latest research findings in your area. Publishing a preprint allows you to gain feedback early. Preprints can also allow policy makers and practitioners to make decisions based on the latest research, and early-career researchers to build up a publication record quickly.",

Someone not familiar with technical language (e.g. a non-researcher member of the general public) might benefit from plain language summaries of the research and its potential use and impact, which could be through the form of a blog post for example (for more on diversity of scientific outputs see Week 8). Someone with dyslexia might find it difficult to read academic papers printed in a font that isn’t clear to read – yet there are dyslexia-friendly fonts readily available, that could make all the difference.\nIn this course, we will only touch on a few aspects of accessibility to knowledge produced by research, but we encourage you to think about other ways you can increase accessibility of your research.",

    "text": "7.1 Privilege in academia\nEven if we were to implement all the open research practices outlined in the previous weeks, our research can’t be fully open unless it’s open to everyone. It isn’t equally easy for everyone to enter a career in academia, due to different kinds of systemic inequality.\nThis week, we will continue to explore the principle of accessibility by considering how open research can challenge such inequalities. You will discover how diversity can improve the quality of research and read inspiring examples of how ‘big science’ can be ‘good science’. By the end of this week, you will be ready for Week 8, where we help you to launch yourself into your open research future.\nInequities in academia and research are a big issue, showing up in various ways like gender, race, disability, and elitism. In Weeks 5 and 6, you discovered some examples of how researchers don’t all have equal access to opportunities. This relates to privilege, often described as unearned access or advantage, which specific groups of people have because of their membership of a particular social group.\nWomen and minorities often hit roadblocks when it comes to climbing the career ladder or getting access to key resources, which means they’re not as well represented in top positions or in prestigious research projects. People with disabilities face both physical challenges and unhelpful attitudes that can make it tough to fully take part. On top of that, elitism tends to favour those from more privileged backgrounds and institutions, keeping opportunities out of reach for many.\nEveryone working and studying in academia has a duty to support researchers who face greater barriers, and to influence their institutions and organisations to make positive change to encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion.",

    "text": "7.2 Diversity\nWhen we think about making research more diverse, we can think about this at three several different levels, for example:\n\ndiversity of samples\ndiversity of researchers\ndiversity of methodology\ndiversity of outputs\n\nIt is important that we work towards diversity in each of these domains in our respective fields.\n\n7.2.1 Diversity of samples\nIn Week 3, you learned about generalisability. One facet of generalisability is whether or not your findings will apply in different cultures and contexts around the world. When collecting human data, a ‘sample’ is the group of people who take part in a research study. It’s important to think about ways to collect diverse samples for our research, as a more diverse sample will represent the wider population better than a less diverse one. Thus, {{term “samplingV|sampling variation”&gt;}}, which means the extent to which the data vary in different samples taken from the same population, is key to collecting and interpreting human data.\nAlthough researchers may not have the funds to collect data in multiple countries, there are smaller ways they can extend their samples, for example:\n\nCollecting data from multicultural populations in their own country\nCollaborating with a researcher in another country\nGetting involved in big team science\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Diversity of researchers\nIt is important to make sure your research teams are as diverse as possible. This is for reasons of equity, but also because people coming from different perspectives are likely to bring different ideas and insights to the research, making it richer! Here are some examples of ways that a diverse team of researchers can help a project be better:\n\nA team with members from various backgrounds can offer unique insights into culturally-specific health behaviours or practices in medical research.\nIncluding researchers with disabilities can lead to innovative solutions for accessibility in technology design.\nA mix of genders on a team can provide a balanced approach to studying gender differences in workplace dynamics or tackling workplace harassment.\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Diversity of methodology\nWhen we have more diverse teams, this can open our eyes to new perspectives and lead to new methodological approaches. It’s possible that your existing methodology cannot just be copied and pasted into a new cultural context, and instead would need many modifications to be culturally appropriate. For instance, research exploring a global reading intervention that only considered reading text from right to left might not be appropriate in cultures where text is read left to right. There are lots of different ways that you can try to diversify your research methodology, for example:\n\nA quantitative researcher collaborating with a qualitative researcher.\nTalking to colleagues from different fields about how to improve your research methodology.\nCollaborating cross-culturally on a new study design or rolling out an old study design in a new context.\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Diversity of outputs\nThere are many ways of sharing research findings beyond academic journal articles (for example you have already learned about open data and open materials). Reviews themselves can also be made open, see for example the Publish Your Reviews initiative (ASAPBio, 2024). Platforms such as Jisc’s Octopus challenge conventional practices and promote transparency and collaboration through allowing researchers to publish a variety of outputs. Additionally, podcasts, blogs, videos, and social media also offer powerful ways to increase reach and engagement, ensuring research impacts broader audiences. Here are some examples of ways of diversifying the outputs of your research:\n\nAn educational psychologist could write a blog post summarising the results of their study, sharing this blog post with researchers, teachers, and parents/carers.\nA climate scientist could create a short, engaging video explaining their latest findings, tailored for a general audience and shared widely on social media.\nA historian could launch a podcast series discussing key insights from archival research, inviting guest experts and fostering a dialogue with listeners from diverse backgrounds.\n\n\nActivity 2\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nThis activity encourages you to reflect on practice in your own research setting.\nWrite down steps you could take to increase the diversity of your samples, collaborators, and methodology. This will be different depending on your field and career stage, but you should be able to think about at least one actionable step for each!",

    "text": "7.3 Equity, diversity and inclusion\nThe next video is about a group of researchers who had the courage to confront some difficult questions. Dr Carina Bossu of the Open University’s Institute for Educational Technology tells the story of how her team took the challenges of equity, diversity and inclusion seriously. As you watch, think about the measures Carina’s team implemented, and whether these measures could apply in your own setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Transcript - Click to expand\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Carina Bossu. I’m a senior lecturer in academic professional development with the Institute of Educational Technology here at the Open University. I’m also a lead of the equity, diversity and inclusion project within the Go-GN network.\nThe Go-GN network, which is the global OER graduate network, as the name suggests, is a network to support researchers in open education in general, several fields of open education.\nThey have their own supervisors, they are enrolled in their own institutions, but they come to us for additional support.\nWe provide webinars, resources, and we have also our annual meeting where we bring these researchers together to be part of the broader network.\nThe idea of, you know, creating a project specifically focused on EDI, equity, diversity and inclusion, came because, you know, there is an assumption that because we work in open education or we work in open research, there is an assumption that the word ‘open’ means equitable, diverse and inclusive - and it’s not always the case.\nFor example, in Go-GN, the majority of our members are from the Global North, they are white and they speak English.\nWe realised that, and decided then to understand what could be a Go-GN that is more inclusive. So we applied for an additional grant and we set off to talk to people from the Global South. We went first in Africa and spoke with some experts there, and that first Phase, that’s what we called it, was then used to generate the first guidelines for EDI in Go-GN, but also informed Phase 2 of the project, which was in Latin America, where we then went there to speak with experts in open education and find out - what would look like a more equitable, diverse and inclusive network?\nAfter these two Phases, we then set out to start implementing the recommendations we received from participants.\nSo we have now implemented a lot of the recommendations into Go-GN, but we have also published that in forms of guidelines.\nWe have a paper, we have blog posts.\nSo just an example of some of the recommendations we received from experts is that, for example, in Go-GN, all the resources we provide are in English. And they wouldn’t be able to read that. So what we did, we translated a lot of those resources into Portuguese and Spanish. We have plans now to translate more resources into different languages.\nAnother way we try to be more inclusive is to provide on-demand translation during our webinar. So there is a software that can help us with that. So we are looking into this.\nWe are now offering scholarships to researchers to help them with their research, but also to help with their career progress, and we give priority to Global South candidates.\nEDI now is not a separate project, it is part of Go-GN, so it’s one of our strengths. And this means that the work that we do will always have an EDI focus, so then the work that we do also will help everyone that can benefit from it.\n\n\n\n\nPromoting equity, diversity and inclusion\nThink about the steps Carina and her colleagues at the Go-GN Network took. Could you do something similar in your own organisation?\nAllow about 10 minutes.\n Take some notes on what steps you might take.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nCarina explains that she and her colleagues recognised a lack of diversity within their network. Once they had realised this, they sought research funding to address the issue. They went directly to people in the Global South, seeking their opinions about how the network could become more diverse and inclusive. These people pointed out barriers to diversity and inclusion, and challenged the researchers to address them. Their ideas are now being implemented, resulting in lasting change.",

    "text": "7.4 Big team science\nIn Week 3, you were introduced to big team science – large-scale projects where researchers from around the world conduct the same study and pool their results. As well as having benefits for sample size and the ability to investigate generalisability of findings, big team science also has the potential to increase diversity, equity and inclusivity in research.\nHere are some examples of big team science projects.\n\nThe Human Genome Project aimed to map and understand all the genes of the human species, and in 2003 successfully identified the approximately twenty to twenty-five thousand genes in human DNA. The magnitude of this challenge brought together expertise of interdisciplinary groups from across the world, including experts in engineering, biology, computer science, and so on.\nCERN and the Large Hadron Collider aimed to explore fundamental questions about the universe, and in 2012, discovered the Higgs boson, confirming a key part of the Standard Model of particle physics. The project required the perspectives of over twelve thousand scientists, from more than one hundred nationalities. They collaborated in a culture where decisions were made through intense discussions about the scientific merits of rival proposals, rather than hierarchy.\nThe project ManyPrimates aims to study primate cognition and behaviour through large-scale, collaborative experiments across multiple primate research facilities. The study includes a systematic review, to challenge the idea that knowledge can be effectively generated by looking at a limited number of primate species at a few sites. The initial projects have focused on understanding the cognitive abilities of different primate species.\n\nYou can get involved in big team science either by joining an existing organisation or by starting a project yourself! If there is an existing big team science initiative in your field that is open to new members, this can be a good starting point. For example, the Psychological Science Accelerator brings psychology researchers together to pool resources for large global studies in psychology. Anyone can join an existing project in various roles, depending on their knowledge and experience including data collection and translation. Anyone can also propose their own project during open ‘calls for studies’.\nAlthough the term ‘big team science’ implies the research is scientific, there is no reason why some of the principles behind big team science can’t be applied to non-scientific research. There are inspiring collaborative projects in the humanities, too:\n\nReligious Peace and Toleration (RETOPEA) is an international community of researchers who develop educational tools and recommendations to promote peaceful understanding between young people of different religions, spiritualities and worldviews.\nThe Pelagios Network, which you looked at in Week 1, is a community of researchers, data scientists and curators who use linked data methods and tools to investigate the past.",

    "section": "7.5 Limitations of big team science",
    "text": "7.5 Limitations of big team science\nIt is important to note that although big team science has the potential to increase diversity, equity and inclusion, this does not happen automatically. There are many ways that researchers can be inadvertently excluded from big team science, for example:\n\nResearchers are sometimes not paid to participate in these projects, and instead do so for academic ‘rewards’ such as authorship on the eventual paper. This means that those who cannot afford to do this unpaid work may not be able to participate.\nSometimes, the lead team can come up with the entire design for the study, without input from their international team, so many researchers end up only collecting data without having wider input in the study.\nUsually, all communication about a big team science study is done in one language, so researchers who do not speak that language will be unable to collaborate on the project, and those who only speak some of that language may struggle to understand what is needed of them.\n\n\nAs with all research, an active effort needs to be made to include a diverse range of researchers in a project. Big team science does pose a good starting model for this, and many researchers are currently working on ways to make these kinds of projects more inclusive, for example through on-boarding collaborators at the design stage so that they can have input very early on in the project, and creating training materials for researchers. For example, ManyBabies – a big team science project for developmental research – has several initiatives to try to increase diverse participation. For example, ManyBabies has a student advisor, monthly drop-in hours, and hosts training workshops on different research-relevant topics (e.g. behavioural coding).\n\nActivity 3\nAllow about 20 minutes.\nImagine you received a huge grant for a big team science project in your field. Which questions would you prioritise answering? How would you encourage participation from a diverse range of collaborators? How would you coordinate everything logistically?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nThere are many things you might have thought about, depending on your research area! \nYou may have thought about which questions would be most important to answer in your field, or which questions would most benefit from having global data collection.\nYou might have thought about ways that you could encourage participation from diverse collaborators including offering clear documentation, training, and reaching out to your extended networks.\nYou might have thought of logistic concerns such as how you’d track the progress of the project, how you’d communicate with your collaborators, and how you’d ensure the project progressed through different stages.\n\nFor some advice on how to manage a big team science project, see these slides.\n  \n\n\n\n7.5.1 The open research decision tree\nHere’s another chance to explore the decision tree. It has been designed to help you conduct open research in the future, by reminding you about the principles of open research and what actions you can take to make your research open, at any stage of your research project.\n\n\n\nClick to open an interactive tool created by Open University.\n\n\n\nActivity 4\nAllow around 10 minutes.\nClick the image to open an interactive tool created by Open University.\n\nUse the open research decision tree to remind yourself about principles in open research. Imagine you wanted to remind yourself about open access journals. You learned about this in Week 6. To do this, click the Principles button, then the Accessibility button. Then select the Open access articles and journal models option. What do you find there? How is the Principles branch of the decision tree organised?\nNow think about how you can apply open research principles (such as replicability, generalisability and robustness) to a research project you have already started. If you don’t have one in mind, think of an imaginary project. Use the open research decision tree to consider what actions you can take to make your project more accessible. To do this, go back to the beginning of the decision tree, click the Actions button, then I’ve started. Select Collaborating with others and publishing your paper. That will take you to parts of this course that relate to accessibility. Can you relate the actions to your project?\nNow compare what happens if you have finished your project. Think of an ongoing project, or an imaginary one. Go back to the beginning of the decision tree, click the Actions button, then I’ve finished. Select Making data and materials accessible. Again, you will find various links to the course about how you can make your research accessible. What are they? Can you find any other actions that relate to accessibility?\n\n Take notes on what you find out.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nIn Part 1, you should have been able to find your way to the section of Week 6 that refers to open access publishing. In other words, you moved from the principles of accessibility and open action to the action of publishing.\n\nIn Part 2, you may have found your way through actions like collaborating with others, publishing a preprint or publishing open access to ideas that relate to the principle of accessibility.\n\nIn Part 3, a prompt to check for geographical, cultural and language barriers may have brought you back to ideas of accessibility you learned in this week. The open research decision tree is organised in a way that throws up ideas and offers a quick way of accessing information from the course.",

You discovered why these principles are important, and which open practices you can enact to ensure your own research is more in line with them.\nNow is the time to find out how you can commit to open research and make these practices a part of your research habits and norms!\nResearch is behaviour – we do research. Engaging in open research means engaging in a variety of specific behaviours. Some of these behaviours may have even been discouraged in some of the research training you have received, depending on when you did your research training. For this reason, it can be useful to think of engaging in open research as just another behaviour that you can think about changing, like healthy eating or exercising!\nThe COM-B model proposes that capability, opportunity, and motivation are necessary for behaviour change. The diagram below summarises what the COM-B model says about the conditions that are most likely to lead to effective behaviour change.\nIn a survey of researchers in psychology departments across the UK and Ireland, researchers found that capability, opportunity, and motivation all affected someone’s likelihood to engage in open research practices (e.g. preregistration, and open data and materials). However, the strongest predictor was automatic motivation – that is, the researcher agrees with these statements:\nDo you agree with these statements?",

It can be onerous to find and navigate the multiple platforms, software packages and systems.\nLuckily, the Open Science Framework (OSF) does a lot of this work for us. The OSF is a free, open platform that supports research and enables collaboration. It also provides guides on different aspects of open research. The OSF is not the only way to engage with different open research practices, but since it has functionality that covers several open research practices at once, it can be a good place to start. Some of the ways that you can use the OSF are outlined below.\nProjects\nOSF projects allows you to plan, collaborate, and organise your research studies. First, you create an OSF account. Then create a project: think of it as a folder for everything to do with one study. You can add collaborators, upload files, and review any additional capabilities that you may or may not want to use (e.g. integration with different software like Google docs or GitHub). Projects can be kept private or made public, so this can be a great way to share your data and materials publicly when they’re ready. Some people find it helpful to add materials as they progress with a study, and others just upload everything when finished.\nPreregistration\nYou can also use the OSF to preregister your studies. Preregistration plans can be of various levels of specificity (from answering a few quick questions to creating extensive documents including analysis plans), and these different levels can all be preregistered on the OSF with a variety of templates for research from different disciplines or methodologies. After you have drafted your preregistration, once you ‘register’ them officially, they get locked and timestamped. You can link your preregistration to your OSF project, which also enables you to include any additional documents related to your project.\nPreprints\nYou can also use the OSF to upload a preprint of your work. As you learned in Week 6, a preprint is an open-access version of your work. A preprint server is the platform that hosts your preprint: it is free to access, both for you, the uploader, and your readers. Preprint servers are usually by research discipline, but can also be organised in other ways, e.g. AfricaArXiv is a preprint server for research done by African researchers across all disciplines. Several preprint servers are hosted through the OSF (including, but not limited to, PsyArXiv, SocArXiv, and SportRxiv. If none of the listed servers represent your work well then you can also upload your preprint under the general ‘OSF preprints’. You can also link the preprint to your OSF project, so readers can easily access other materials related to your project.\nIn general, the OSF is a great ‘one-stop shop’ for enacting many of the open research practices that you have learned about in this course. By learning how to navigate and use this one platform, you can integrate many open research practices into your research habits. But it is not the only trusted repository – as you learned in Week 2, there are various institutional and discipline repositories. The Open University also has its own research repository for collaborating, planning and organising research projects, called ORDO.\n\nActivity 2\nAllow about 20 minutes.\nThis activity will familiarise you with two open access repositories: ORDO and OSF.\n\n\nActivity 2.1\nBrowse through ORDO and see if you can find a dataset for a project called ‘Building trust in digital policing: A scoping review of community policing apps’ published by an author of this course. How many categories (fields) are included in this project?\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nYou should have been able to locate the dataset. It was part of a research project which included seven fields of study, and the dataset has been downloaded several hundred times. It is stored on ORDO under a permanent, citable web link.\n  \n\n\n\nActivity 2.2\nNow, we turn our attention to the OSF. If you belong to a discipline for which the OSF would not be a natural choice, you can substitute a different repository that is targeted to your discipline.\nMake an OSF account (if you don’t already have one), and create a project for one of your research studies. You can keep it private so don’t worry about making it perfect! Go through some of the OSF guides, then upload some documents and organise your project into different components and subfolders.\n\n  Show / Hide Discussion\n  \n  \nYou have now set up your own OSF account and created a project. You can choose to make the elements of your project public when you’re ready, or if you are using this as a private practice run, that’s okay too. It’s useful to keep OSF guides nearby while you familiarise yourself with the OSF platform. Keep practicing and if you like, explore other features e.g. adding collaborators (contributors) to projects!",

    "text": "8.3 Finding your community\nHaving access to resources that help you engage in open research practices is a great first step, but navigating your open research journey will be so much easier if you surround yourself with like-minded people who can help each other. Being a part of a community means you have people you can turn to if you have questions: you can learn from each other’s mistakes and successes, and maybe even forge collaborations!\n\nNowhere Lab\nNowhere Lab is an online community that anyone can join that holds weekly Zoom meetings and has an active Slack community. It is hosted by the lead author of this course. Although Nowhere Lab is not explicitly focused on open research, open research is a topic that is heavily covered, whether that be through discussion sessions, journal clubs (where members discuss a paper together), or training on different open research practices.\n\n\n\n\nFORRT\nThe Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) is a community of educators who wish to integrate open science principles into their teaching. They strive for open and reproducible research training, advancing research transparency, reproducibility, rigour, and ethics through educational reform. FORRT provides educational infrastructure and resources designed to support the teaching and mentoring of open and reproducible science. You can explore their resources directly to learn more about open research, and join their Slack community.\n\n\n8.3.1 Open research across disciplines\nInterdisciplinary communities can be great for learning about how open research affects different fields differently. They can also be helpful for finding out how open research is done in your specific field. For this, check out Open Research Across Disciplines – a tool for exploring open research resources and case studies across fields. You can also use this resource to find people working on open research in your field and even reach out to them!\nBig team science\nBig team science has been mentioned a few times in this course, and it’s worth noting that as well as the benefits for credibility and accessibility of research, big team science can also be a great way of finding and building community. Joining a big team science project in your field can be a great way to learn about open research and get started in some open research practices before applying them to your own research.\n\nActivity 3.1\nAllow about 10 minutes.\nUse the Open Research Across Disciplines tool to find resources for open research in your field. Think about how you could apply these tools or ideas to your own research habits.\nGo back to your notes for Activity 1 of this week, where you were asked to write down ideas of how you could implement open research as part of your everyday research habits. Now, think about how you can share your data and materials from a research project you have finished. If you have not finished a project yet, you can use an imaginary one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 3.2\nAllow about 10 minutes\nClick the image to open an interactive tool created by Open University.\n\n\n\nClick to open an interactive tool created by Open University.\n\n\nUse the open research decision tree to look up some possibilities. Click on the link to the open research decision tree, click the Actions button, then the I’ve finished button. This will take you to about ten possible actions you could take. What are they? Not all of these actions may be appropriate or achievable in your particular project – that’s fine! Once you have lined up some possible courses of action, you can choose the ones that are most practicable.\n Record in your notes what you find.",

This week, you explored how to incorporate open research into your research routine by using the support and resources that are out there, and discovering your own open research community.\nOver this whole open research course, you’ve learned about why transparency, credibility, and accessibility are so important in open research, and how to apply these values to your own research. You have explored some of the actions that you can take in order to ensure your research complies with these. You have developed skills in key processes of open research, such as replication, preregistration, transparent writing, robustness analysis and open publishing.\nWe hope you have enjoyed the course, and that you will continue enjoy taking what you have learned here into the wider world of open research.",
