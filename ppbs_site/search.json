We are revamping our website in anticipation of the 10-year anniversary of PPBS! 🎉 For now, some pages and functionalities may not be working as intended. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nProject Overview\n\nThe Psychology of Political Behavior Studies (PPBS) are an ongoing series of quota-based national cross-sections, and its replication analogues, containing a set of repeating core questions on the topics of social and political attitudes, values, voting and candidate preferences, and political participation. PPBS leverages 12 datasets, collected through professional survey companies, for a combined N of 21.107 interviews. PPBS includes four nationally representative cross-sections of the American population (N=7.259) during the last three elections in the US (i.e., Presidential 2016 and 2020, and Midterms 2018), their replication/confirmatory analogues (N=11.582) in pre- and post-election studies, with added survey-specific repeated measures recontacts (N=2.215) across three time-points, allowing for both within and between research designs. Taken together, PBBS has surveyed more than 60 political and psychological constructs, many of which using its full instruments, allowing for the testing of competing explanations of the psychology of political behavior.\nBelow you find two visual representations, one of PPBS’s field periods broken-down by sample type, and another on the timeline of when each construct was surveyed. The motivation behind PPBS (i.e., the why, what, and how) is described here.\nThe methodology of all PPBS surveys can be found in the menu above. Collaborators, funders and investigators can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPPBS Surveys organized by sample type\n\n\nNationally Representative (N=7259)\n\n\n2016 Pre-election sample (N=1500)\n2018 Pre-election sample (N=1000)\n2018 Post-election sample (N=2759)\n2020 Pre-election sample (N=2000)\n\n\nConfirmatory/Replication (N=11582)\n\n\n2016 Pre-election sample (N=2119)\n2016 Pre-election sample (N=420)\n2018 Pre-election sample (N=2728)\n2018 Post-election sample (N=3377)\n2020 Pre-election sample (N=2938)\n\n\nRecontacts or Longitudinal or Panel (N=2215)\n\n\n2016 Pre-election sample (N=814)\n2018 Pre-election sample (N=609)\n2018 Post-election sample (N=792)\n\n \n\n\nPPBS Surveys organized by date\n\n\n2016 Pre-election Nationally Representative sample (N=1500)\n2016 Pre-election Confirmatory/Replication sample (N=2119)\n2016 Pre-election 2nd Study Convenience sample (N=420)\n2016 Pre-election Recontacts/Longitudinal Convenience sample (N=814)\n2018 Pre-election Nationally Representative sample (N=1000)\n2018 Pre-election Confirmatory/Replication sample (N=2728)\n2018 Post-election Nationally Representative sample (N=2759)\n2018 Post-election Confirmatory/Replication sample (N=3377)\n2018 Pre-election Recontacts/Longitudinal Convenience sample (N=609)\n2018 Post-election Recontacts/Longitudinal Convenience sample (N=792)\n2020 Pre-election Nationally Representative sample (N=2000)\n2020 Pre-election Confirmatory/Replication sample (N=2938)"

    "text": "Collective Narcissism\n(de Zavala et al., 2009)\nCollective narcissism describes an “ingroup identification tied to an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the unparalleled greatness of an ingroup” (Zavala et al., 2009). It expresses a sense of entitlement and a strong need for external recognition of the ingroup’s uniqueness and superiority.\n\n\n\n\nConspiracy Mentality\n(Bruder et al., 2013;  Lantian et al., 2016)\nConspiracy theories are defined as “unverified and relatively implausible allegations, claiming that significant events are the result of a secret plot carried out by a preternaturally sinister and powerful group” (Bruder et al., 2013).\n\nConspiratorial Thinking\nA generalized tendency to adopt conspiratorial explanations for events, rather than accepting official or mainstream accounts.\n\n\nBelief in Climate-change Conspiracies\nConspiracy theories claiming the scientific community’s consensus on global warming does not reflect reality and is motivated by political and/or financial reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nEgalitarianism\n(Feldman, 1988;  ANES 1983 Pilot Study)\nFormal equality of all people regardless of their social status. Within neoliberal logic, egalitarianism and economic individualism are conflicted. Therefore, formal or political equality is emphasized, while resource or economic equality may be minimized.\n\n\n\n\nEmpathy\n(Davis, 1983)\nEmpathy is an important component of social cognition, relating to the reactions of one individual to the observed experiences of another (Davis, 1983). Empathy consists of distinct but related facets.\n\nEmpathic Concern\nCaptures feelings of sympathy and concern for (unfortunate) others (Davis, 1983).\n\n\nPerspective Taking\nMeasures the tendency to spontaneously adopt the point of view of another person in order to understand their emotions and behavior (Davis 1983).\n\n\nPersonal Distress\nMeasures self-oriented feelings of personal anxiety and unease in tense interpersonal settings, which can prevent helping others. Negatively related to social functioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalism\n(ISSP, 2010;  Loy et al., 2012)\nAttitudes toward the protection of the natural environment in the context of government law initiatives, economic growth, and personal sacrifices.\n\n\n\n\nJustice Sensitivity\n(Baumert et al., 2013)\nJustice Sensitivity is a trait variable reflecting individual concern for justice in daily life. People differ significantly in their perception of and reaction to injustice.\n\nVictim Perspective\nOwn disadvantage — Perspective on an unjust situation where one sees oneself as the affected victim, predicting emotional reactions like anger toward perceived injustice.\n\n\nBeneficiary Perspective\nOwn advantage — Perspective on an unjust situation, in which the observing person benefits from an injustice. Predicts solidarity with those disadvantaged.\n\n\nObserver Perspective\nSomeone else’s disadvantage — Perspective on an unjust situation, in which the observer is not directly involved. Predicts solidarity with disadvantaged others.\n\n\nPerpetrator Perspective\nTreat someone unfairly — Perspective in which the observer has committed the injustice, raising feelings of guilt, prompting compensation or self-punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nLibertarianism\nLibertarianism is an ideology prevalent in the US that prioritizes liberty over other values, advocating individual freedom above deference to authority, traditional norms, or equality.\nScale (22 items): A comprehensive measurement instrument for assessing the multi-faceted traits of libertarianism.\n\nLibertarianism Identification\nMeasures self-identification with libertarian ideology.\n\n\nSymbolic Libertarianism\nCaptures non-material, value-based expressions of libertarian beliefs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarcissism\n(Morf & Rhodewalt, 2001)\nA complex of personality traits involving a grandiose yet fragile sense of self and entitlement, and a preoccupation with success and demands for admiration.\n\n\n\n\nNational Identification\n(Pehrson et al., 2009)\nIdentification of individuals with their respective national group. National identification can shape intergroup attitudes and behavior, and is associated with collective memory, pride, and sometimes, prejudice.\n\n\n\n\nNationalism\n(Gellner, 2006) Hobsbawm, 1992)\nAcross disciplines, nationalism is seen as the principle that statehood and nationhood should become congruent by actualizing national unity, sovereignty, and identity.\n\n\n\n\nNativism\n(Mudde, 2007) Mudde, 2019)\nNativism combines nationalism and xenophobia. It calls for states to comprise only members of the native group and considers non-native elements to be fundamentally threatening to the monocultural nation-state.\n\n\n\n\nNeeds / Psychological Motivations\n(Hennes et al., 2012 Jost et al., 2008)\nPsychological needs characterize requirements to manage uncertainty, threat, and social belonging, and to create certainty, security, and solidarity.

    "text": "What is PPBS?\n\nThe Psychology of Political Behavior Studies (PPBS) are an ongoing series of quota-based national cross-sections containing the same core questions on social and political attitudes, values, voting, and political participation of more than 20,000 Americans. PPBS aims to inform politico-psychological explanations of political behavior, attitudes, values, voting, and participation. The studies are broad-ranging and include researchers from a number of American and European universities, including the University of Jena and University of Cologne (Germany), University of Washington (US), Université Grenoble Alpes (France), Long Island University (US), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Maastricht (The Netherlands), University of Arkansas (US), and University of Minho (Portugal).\nPPBS leverages 12 datasets collected through professional survey companies for a combined N of 21.107 interviews, including four nationally representative cross-sections of the American population (N=7.259) during last three elections in the US (i.e., Presidential 2016 and 2020, and Midterms 2018). It also includes their replication/confirmatory analogues (N=11.582), in pre- and post-election studies, with added repeated measures for three surveys (N=2.215) across two time-points, allowing for both within and between investigations.\nPPBS includes a true interdisciplinary selection of constructs relevant to both fields comprising Political Psychology: Social Psychology and Political Science. From Political Science, PPBS surveys traditional party- and ideology identities, feeling thermometer, political participation, voter registration, and political sophistication. From Psychology, PBBS surveys constructs such as various types of System Justification, Social Dominance Orientation, Needs, Collective Narcissism, and Justice Concerns. PPBS also surveys relevant constructs used in both fields such as social attitudes and prejudice, but also those conceptualized and measured differently across fields (e.g., right-wing authoritarianism in Social Psychology and child-reading attitudes in Political Science). Taken together, it amounts to more than 60 political and psychological constructs, allowing for the testing of competing explanations of the psychology of political behavior."

    "section": "Why PPBS?",
    "text": "Why PPBS?\n\n\nPPBS is an attempt to unite theoretical and methodological insights from two, fairly independent, sciences studying the same phenomena: the psychology of political behavior. It is well established that scholars from the two main fields composing Political Psychology adopt widely different practices when conducting research. Political scientists and psychologists often differ when it comes to samples types, sample sizes, constructs & measures, statistical techniques, choice of control variables, and data collection philosophies and methods. PPBS was conceived as an attempt to bridge the two major approaches to scientific research in Political Psychology, in both substantive and methodological spheres. On one hand, PBBS takes insights from Political Science by drawing heavily from Political Behavior measures of gold-standard national election surveys (e.g., ANES, GSS, VOTER). On the other hand, PPBS draws insights from Psychology in that it surveys full instruments of a rich variety of psychological constructs thought to underlie and motivate political behavior. The methodological dimension of PPBS sought to combine Political Science’s literature on survey methodology with Psychology’s psychometrics and measurement. Finally, PPBS sought to incorporate the lessons from the social sciences’ “credibility revolutions” (for a review in Political Science, see Wuttke, 2019; for Psychology, see Vazire, 2018) and implement for its surveys demographic representation, high N, and an exploratory and replication/confirmatory design in which the same survey instrument is fielded in two separate groups from the same source to increase robustness and avoid false positives. Taken together, these characteristics reflect a desire for improved practices in both substantive and methodological spheres for research in Political Psychology.\nIn specific, there are 7 underlying substantive and methodological motivations for the creation of PPBS. They are: theory construction; the inter-relations of political psychological constructs; sample type and size; ad-hoc selection of politico-psychological constructs; reproducibility of findings in political psychology; effect-size benchmarking; and promoting the development of a cumulative approach to the psychology of political behavior. Below these are fleshed out in more detail. Please note this is a work in progress.\n\n\nTheory construction. While Political Science and Psychology are broad disciplines, and one should not generalize across their sub-domains, it is fairly accepted that theories about political behavior, and its psychology, lack of integration. Several authors, across social sciences, likened lack of theory integration to the reproducibility crises (Borsboom, 2013; Klein, 2014; Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2019; Oberauer & Lewandowsky, 2019; Smaldino, 2017). Mischel (2008), speaking about psychology and its sub-disciplines, explained that political psychologists tend to treat other scholars’ theories like toothbrushes - no self-respecting person wants to use anyone else’s. Known as the “tooth-brush problem”, it suggests that social scientists interested in understanding political behavior may be nurturing practices that are to the detriment of the quality of the science produced. That is to say, hardly ever, these constructs are compared and contrasted, which is a major obstacle towards the ideal of an integrative view of social sciences. For example, while RWA and SDO are usually surveyed in tandem, System Justification, MFQ, Values, Empathy, Collective Narcissism, Justice Concerns and Emotions –to name a few– tend to be surveyed -and empirically tested- within their own theoretical framework. And as theory depends on the iterative process Theory &lt;-&gt; Data (Borsboom et al, 2020), and as theories based on social constructs can only be understood in relation to their inter-relationships (i.e., nomological network), the lack of data allowing for (existing) theories to be compared and contrasted via the inter-relations of political psychological constructs precludes the building of richer, more integrative theories of the psychology of political behavior.\nSample type and size. Political scientists and psychologists differ substantially when it comes to sample type and size in their typical studies. Social psychologists have historically relied on student, snowball convenience samples. The lack of representation from several population strata constrain the extent to which its findings generalize to the population, limiting its external validity. Furthermore, (social) psychological studies tend to be, on average, widely underpowered (for a review, see Crutzen & Peters, 2017). This is particularly troublesome as the median effect-size studied in Psychology is of about r = 0.1, and there is a wide discrepancy between reported effect sizes with and without pre-registration (Schäfer & Schwarz, 2019). For these reasons, it is important to test (social) psychological hypotheses with large, representative samples (and ideally, costs not forbidding it, random samples too).\nAd-hoc selection of proper treatment of politico-psychological constructs. Political scientists typically make use of items already present in national election studies and cross-national surveys as proxies for their constructs. This practice is classified as a known questionable measurement practice (Eiko and Flake, 2018), and it can bias results for at least two reasons. With the use of proxies, short-scales and on-the-fly scales, the quality of measurement suffers. In addition, and because of the unconstrained choice of questions/items, research based on this approach essentially leads to a garden of forking paths. As substantiated by recent reproducibility projects in both psychology and political science, researchers – often unknowingly – create false positives/negatives highly contingent on their analytic choices.\n\n\n\nReproducibility of findings. Psychologists have been the first social science field to look at its scientific output and diagnose a reproducibility problem. Other sciences followed suit, and it turns out ‘the reproducibility crisis’ is not confined to Psychology by any measure of the imagination. Indeed, similar rates of reproducibility have been found in Political Science (cf. Janz, 2012) and Economics (cf. EERP, 2016), and have brought to the fore a series of threats to the integrity of scientific research, including questionable research practices (QRPs) and questionable measurement practices (QMPs), failures to replicate, and publication biases. In this sense, there is a sudden need to get back to the basics and establish whether or not a given phenomenon produces stable and consistent effect sizes. Similar to the philosophy and goals of Psychological Science Accelerator and Many Labs, political psychologist would benefit from studies examining the reproducibility of established, political psychological phenomena.\n\n\n\nEffect-size benchmarking. Most psychologists, and an increasing number of Political Science departments, are obligated to obtain permission for their studies from their University’s internal review board (IRB). The IRB usually requires the estimation of the study’s power to detect a true positive, which in turn requires a benchmark of the effect-size under investigation. In addition, with the recent advent of registered reports, social scientists at large will increasingly conduct and report their study’s power to detect a true positive. Taken together, demands for the benchmarking of effect sizes in large nationally representative samples are increasing substantially.\n\n\nPromoting the development of a cumulative approach to the psychology of political behavior. The last, but perhaps the most important motivation for PBBS is to promote the development of a cumulative approach to the psychology of political behavior. It is hoped that PPBS helps incentivize cross-field collaborations, and to disseminate and propagate the importance of institutionalization of research structures and scientific output compliant with cumulative scientific principles. This is of importance substantively because current stand-alone approaches often yield incompatible and incomparable findings, hindering political scientists’ and social psychologists’ ability to unite forces towards a united understanding of the psychology of political behavior.\n \n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBorsboom, D.

This report is meant to detail the utilized survey methodology and relevant, general purpose characteristics of both exploratory and confirmatory samples, as well as any extra samples and its combined version. The text is in APA Style and is akin to an APA-like ‘Methods Section’.\nPPBS datasets are designed to have an exploratory, quota-based Nationally Representative sample (on Age, Education, Income and Sex), and a Confirmatory (Replication) convenience sample, from the same data source to avoid false positives. Some PPBS studies also have recontacts or extra-samples to answer additional specific research questions (e.g., 2nd Sample in 2016). All data’s coodbooks can be found at the bottom of the page, with a searchable feature allowing to find metadata within and between columns.\nTaken together, there were three independent samples collected in the months preceding the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election (from August 16th to September 19th, 2016) and amount to 4039 online interviews of American adults, lasting ~55 minutes (Median) for those successfully passing the variety of data quality checks (87%). The 2016 attrition rate was pretty constant at ~22%.\nFor more details, see PBBS’s Motivation.\n\n\n\n\nMetadata of PBBS 2016 Samples\n\n\n\nSample 1\nSample 2\nSample 3\n\n\n\n\nElection cycle\nPre-Election 2016\nPre-Election 2016\nPre-Election 2016\n\n\nType\nNationally Representative\nConfirmatory (Replication)\nExtra (2nd Study)\n\n\nSurvey Period (Start)\nAugust 16th, 2016\nAugust 20th, 2016\nSeptember 15th, 2016\n\n\nSurvey Period (End)\nSeptember 16th, 2016\nSeptember 13th, 2016\nSeptember 19th, 2016\n\n\nCountry\nUnited States\nUnited States\nUnited States\n\n\nAttention Checks\nYes (11; various types)\nYes (11; various types)\nYes (11; various types)\n\n\nTime Checks\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCAPTCHA\nYes (begining of survey)\nYes (begining of survey)\nYes (begining of survey)\n\n\nSample Size (N)\n1500\n2119\n420\n\n\nLength of Interview (MD)\n51.28\n57.77\n55.54\n\n\nAttrition (%)\n0.22\n0.22\n0.23\n\n\nData Quality checks (%)\n0.16\n0.16\n0.07\n\n\n\nNote.

The representativeness of the collected sample is presented in the table below, which shows an average absolute deviation of 11.85% points (MD = 8.03% points) from the desired quotas, with age showing an an average absolute deviation of 0.85% points (MD = 0.72% points), gender 1.73% points (MD = 1.73% points), income 14.27% points (MD = 12.44% points), and education, 27.32% points (MD = 13.12% points), which had the largest spread on the bracket “Less than high school/No high school diploma”, for which we could only arrive at ~25% of the expected frequency, indicating the sample has achieved a moderate level of national representativeness.\nIn addition to administering a much greater number and variety of political and psychological instruments (including full scales) than in other nationally representative surveys (such as ANES, GSS, and WVS), we took a number of steps to insure that the quality of the data would be especially high. These included following professional recommendations to minimize problems of careless responding and satisficing behavior in online survey studies (Meade & Craig, 2012). Specifically, we employed 11 random attention questions, as well as page-time, survey-total, and click count controls. A total of 1500 participants were directed to the survey, and 1500 of them finished the survey (attrition rate 0%). There were 0 (0%) participants who failed more than two attention checks or finished the survey in under ~22 minutes and were therefore excluded. For the final sample of 1500, participants who successfully completed all study materials had a completion time of 69.29 minutes on average (MD: 51.28min).\nThe age distribution of our sample was as follows: 18–24 years (12.87%), 25–34 (17.6%), 35–44 (17.53%), 45–54 (19.47%), 55–65 (15.6%), and older than 65 (16.93%). The ethnic breakdown was: White (82.47%), Black/African American (7.67%), Latino (5.87%), Asian/Pacific Islander (1.93%), Native American (0.87%), Middle Eastern (1.2%). In terms of religion, (67.6% identified as Christian, 0.6% as Muslim, 3.47% as Jewish,15.33% as either Atheist or Agnostic, 13% and responded they are not sure, religion not listed, or refused to answer. With respect to education, 3.4% declared their highest educational achievement to be less high school, 31.67% indicated High school graduate (includes equivalency), 31.4% chose some college ( or associate degree) or no higher-education degree, 20.67% indicated having a Bachelor’s degree, and finally, 12.87% indicated having received a Graduate or professional degree. The median income category was $35,000 to $49,999. The exact distribution of Income is as follows: Less $15,000 (11.87%), $15,000 to $24,999 (12%), $25,000 to $34,999 (11.73%), $35,000 to $49,999 (15.13%), $50,000 to $74,999 (19.47%), $75,000 to $99,999 (12.8%), $100,000 to $149,999 (10.67%) and $150,000 more (6.33%).\n\n\n\n\nNational Representativeness of sample\n\n\nDemographic\nBrackets\nCensus ACS %\nExpected Sample Frequencies\nObserved Frequencies\nExpected vs. Observed Frequencies\nExpected vs. Observed %\nExpected vs. Observed % [Census 2010]*\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n1\nAge\n18 to 24\n0.13\n192\n193\n1\n0.52\n-1.53\n0.13\n0.52\n150117.3\n\n\n2\nAge\n25 to 34\n0.18\n269\n264\n-5\n-1.86\n0.38\n0.18\n-1.86\n150111.6\n\n\n3\nAge\n35 to 44\n0.18\n265\n263\n-2\n-0.75\n0.00\n0.18\n-0.75\n150226.8\n\n\n4\nAge\n45 to 54\n0.19\n290\n292\n2\n0.69\n1.39\n0.19\n0.69\n149793.4\n\n\n5\nAge\n55 to 64\n0.15\n232\n234\n2\n0.86\n0.43\n0.16\n0.86\n150259.1\n\n\n6\nAge\n65 to 80+\n0.17\n253\n254\n1\n0.40\n-1.55\n0.17\n0.40\n150237.5\n\n\n7\nEducation\nLess than high school\n0.14\n204\n51\n-153\n-75.00\n-75.71\n0.03\n-75.00\n150000.0\n\n\n8\nEducation\nHigh school graduate (includes equivalency)\n0.28\n420\n475\n55\n13.10\n9.20\n0.32\n13.10\n150000.0\n\n\n9\nEducation\nSome college (associate degree) or no degree\n0.29\n436\n471\n35\n8.03\n8.28\n0.31\n8.03\nNA\n\n\n10\nEducation\nBachelor's degree\n0.18\n274\n310\n36\n13.14\n14.81\n0.21\n13.14\nNA\n\n\n11\nEducation\nGraduate or professional degree\n0.11\n165\n193\n28\n16.97\n28.67\n0.13\n16.97\nNA\n\n\n12\nGender\nFemale\n0.52\n773\n760\n-13\n-1.68\n2.98\n0.51\n-1.68\n150000.0\n\n\n13\nGender\nMale\n0.48\n727\n740\n13\n1.79\n-2.89\n0.49\n1.79\n149828.2\n\n\n14\nIncome\nLess than $15,000\n0.12\n188\n178\n-10\n-5.32\n-8.72\n0.12\n-5.32\n150000.0\n\n\n15\nIncome\n$15,000 to $24,999\n0.11\n160\n180\n20\n12.50\n0.00\n0.12\n12.50\n150068.0\n\n\n16\nIncome\n$25,000 to $34,999\n0.10\n153\n176\n23\n15.03\n6.67\n0.12\n15.03\n149927.8\n\n\n17\nIncome\n$35,000 to $49,999\n0.14\n202\n227\n25\n12.38\n8.10\n0.15\n12.38\n150400.0\n\n\n18\nIncome\n$50,000 to $74,999\n0.18\n267\n292\n25\n9.36\n8.15\n0.19\n9.36\n149532.7\n\n\n19\nIncome\n$75,000 to $99,999\n0.12\n183\n192\n9\n4.92\n6.67\n0.13\n4.92\n150000.0\n\n\n20\nIncome\n$100,000 to $149,999\n0.13\n195\n160\n-35\n-17.95\n-11.11\n0.11\n-17.95\n149629.6\n\n\n21\nIncome\n$150,000 or more\n0.10\n150\n95\n-55\n-36.67\n-20.83\n0.06\n-36.67\n150000.0\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Note. An important note is that the US Census Bureau makes minor adjustments to its data over time and is not averse to closing tables and/or redesigning them. This is not particular of the US. Hence, the numbers were correct at date of access, which was Monday 1st August, 2016. Furthermore, due to this, we also provide representation in relation to the 2010 US Census, which is shown in the last column. Specifically, we take Gender and Age from U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census and Income and Education from 2010-2014 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, which at the time, were the most accurate data available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown below, the distribution of data points per state tracks well with state population. The date has not been designed to be regionally representative, nor it claims to be, but results are not bad (cf. US Decennial Census Tables). Please note that frequencies add to 1389, not to 1500, due to non-responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso through SSI, we also administered the same survey to a large convenience sample of 2119 American adults (21.47% women) in the months preceding the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election (from August 20 to September 13, 2016).\nWe applied the same quality-control criteria as explained in the Nationally Representative sample. Specifically, we followed recommendations to minimize the problem of careless responding in online studies (Meade & Craig, 2012). A total of 2119 participants were directed to the survey, and 2119 of them finished the survey (attrition rate 0%). There were 0 (0%) participants who failed more than two attention checks or finished the survey in under ~22 minutes and were therefore excluded. For the final sample of 2119, participants who successfully completed all study materials had a completion time of 92.01 minutes on average (MD: 57.77min).\nThe age distribution of our sample was as follows: 18–24 years (9.06%), 25–34 (13.83%), 35–44 (11.42%), 45–54 (2.74%), 55–65 (3.63%), and older than 65 (59.32%). The ethnic breakdown was: White (85.89%), Black/African American (5.05%), Latino (4.11%), Asian/Pacific Islander (2.17%), Native American (0.94%), Middle Eastern (1.84%). In terms of religion, (70.65% identified as Christian, 0.52% as Muslim, 5.57% as Jewish,13.69% as either Atheist or Agnostic, 9.58% and responded they are not sure, religion not listed, or refused to answer. With respect to education, 1.04% declared their highest educational achievement to be less high school, 15.15% indicated High school graduate (includes equivalency), 40.4% chose some college ( or associate degree) or no higher-education degree, 23.88% indicated having a Bachelor’s degree, and finally, 19.54% indicated having received a Graduate or professional degree.

There were 0 (0%) participants who failed more than two attention checks or finished the survey in under ~22 minutes and were therefore excluded. For the final sample of 3619, participants who successfully completed all study materials had a completion time of 82.6 minutes on average (MD: 55.15min).\nThe age distribution of our sample was as follows: 18–24 years (10.64%), 25–34 (15.39%), 35–44 (13.95%), 45–54 (9.67%), 55–65 (8.59%), and older than 65 (41.75%).

An important note is that the US Census Bureau makes minor adjustments to its data over time and is not averse to closing tables and/or redesigning them. This is not particular of the US. Hence, the numbers were correct at date of access, which was Monday 1st August, 2016. Furthermore, due to this, we also provide representation in relation to the 2010 US Census, which is shown in the last column. Specifically, we take Gender and Age from U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census and Income and Education from 2010-2014 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, which at the time, were the most accurate data available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown below, the distribution of data points per state tracks well with state population. The date has not been designed to be regionally representative, nor it claims to be, but results are not bad (cf. US Decennial Census Tables). Please note that frequencies add to 1389, not to 1500, due to non-responses."

Specifically, we employed 8 random attention questions, 8 page-time controls, and a Captcha question at the beginning of the survey. A total of 2759 participants were directed to the survey, and 2759 of them finished the survey (attrition rate 0%). There were 0 (0%) participants who failed more than two attention checks or finished the survey in under ~22 minutes and were therefore excluded. For the final sample of 2759, participants who successfully completed all study materials had a completion time of 99.82 minutes on average (MD: 60.48min).\nThe age distribution of our sample was as follows: 18–24 years (10.69%), 25–34 (17.91%), 35–44 (16.35%), 45–54 (16.6%), 55–65 (17.04%), and older than 65 (21.42%).

The quotas were designed to match that of the 2018 US Census’ Current Population Survey (CPS) on age, income, education and gender, with a maximum percentual difference of 5% at the bracket level. The representativeness of the collected sample is presented in the table below, which shows an average absolute deviation of 50.18% points (MD = 2.75) from the desired quotas, indicating the sample has achieved a high level of national representativeness.\nIn addition to administering a much greater number and variety of political and psychological instruments (including full scales) than in other nationally representative surveys (such as ANES, GSS, and WVS), we took a number of steps to insure that the quality of the data would be especially high.

It was the original creator of a technological system allowing for an exchange of research panels, counting with a pool of participants in the USA of 13,260,833, and worldwide of 100,000,000+ in over 150 countries. Cint provides an updated, real-time age and gender breakouts by country of its participants’ pool, and is a partner and provider of samples for known giants in the research panels industry like GfK, Lucid, Ipsos, Qualtrics, Kantar, Nielsen, and GMO. Methodologically, Cint applies a variety of industry-standard 3rd party solutions – including Imperium, MaxMind, Firehol, Apility, Google reCAPTCHA and SmartyStreets – and its ISO-20252 compliant proprietary Fraud Detection tool – to ensure data quality. Cint also complies with the codes and guidelines of ESOMAR, CASRO, MRA and applicable national market research associations, as well as all applicable data protection laws/regulations - including EU’s strict GDPR. Most importantly, and contrary to several traditional companies such as YouGov, Cint not only doesn’t require hosting the questionnaire (leaving researchers in control of data quality checking) but welcomes and recommends the deployment of stringent data validation checks, including but not limited to: analysis of questionnaire completion time, data outliers, unanswered questions, patterned responses, straight-lining traps, and red herring questions."

It was the original creator of a technological system allowing for an exchange of research panels, counting with a pool of participants in the USA of 13,260,833, and worldwide of 100,000,000+ in over 150 countries. Cint provides an updated, real-time age and gender breakouts by country of its participants’ pool, and is a partner and provider of samples for known giants in the research panels industry like GfK, Lucid, Ipsos, Qualtrics, Kantar, Nielsen, and GMO. Methodologically, Cint applies a variety of industry-standard 3rd party solutions – including Imperium, MaxMind, Firehol, Apility, Google reCAPTCHA and SmartyStreets – and its ISO-20252 compliant proprietary Fraud Detection tool – to ensure data quality. Cint also complies with the codes and guidelines of ESOMAR, CASRO, MRA and applicable national market research associations, as well as all applicable data protection laws/regulations - including EU’s strict GDPR. Most importantly, and contrary to several traditional companies such as YouGov, Cint not only doesn’t require hosting the questionnaire (leaving researchers in control of data quality checking) but welcomes and recommends the deployment of stringent data validation checks, including but not limited to: analysis of questionnaire completion time, data outliers, unanswered questions, patterned responses, straight-lining traps, and red herring questions."

This report is meant to detail the utilized survey methodology and relevant, general purpose characteristics of both exploratory and confirmatory samples, as well as any extra samples and its combined version. The text is in APA Style and is akin to an APA-like ‘Methods Section’.\nPPBS datasets are designed to have an exploratory, quota-based Nationally Representative sample (on Age, Education, Income and Sex), and a Confirmatory (Replication) convenience sample, from the same data source to avoid false positives. Some PPBS studies also have recontacts or extra-samples to answer additional specific research questions (e.g., 2nd Sample in 2016). All data’s coodbooks can be found at the bottom of the page, with a searchable feature allowing to find metadata within and between columns.\nTaken together, there were three independent samples collected in the months following the 2018 U.S. Presidential Election (from 1st December 2018 to March 14th, 2019) and amount to 6136 online interviews of American adults, lasting ~69 minutes (Median) for those successfully passing the variety of data quality checks (84%).

The quotas were designed to match that of the 2018 US Census’ Current Population Survey (CPS) on age, income, education and gender, with a maximum percentual difference of 5% at the bracket level. The representativeness of the collected sample is presented in the table below, which shows an average absolute deviation of 3.22% points (MD = 2.91) from the desired quotas, indicating the sample has achieved a high level of national representativeness.\nIn addition to administering a much greater number and variety of political and psychological instruments (including full scales) than in other nationally representative surveys (such as ANES, GSS, and WVS), we took a number of steps to insure that the quality of the data would be especially high. These included following professional recommendations to minimize problems of careless responding and satisficing behavior in online survey studies (Meade & Craig, 2012).

Methodologically, Cint applies a variety of industry-standard 3rd party solutions – including Imperium, MaxMind, Firehol, Apility, Google reCAPTCHA and SmartyStreets – and its ISO-20252 compliant proprietary Fraud Detection tool – to ensure data quality. Cint also complies with the codes and guidelines of ESOMAR, CASRO, MRA and applicable national market research associations, as well as all applicable data protection laws/regulations - including EU’s strict GDPR. Most importantly, and contrary to several traditional companies such as YouGov, Cint not only doesn’t require hosting the questionnaire (leaving researchers in control of data quality checking) but welcomes and recommends the deployment of stringent data validation checks, including but not limited to: analysis of questionnaire completion time, data outliers, unanswered questions, patterned responses, straight-lining traps, and red herring questions."
